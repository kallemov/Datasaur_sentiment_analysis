0,Update: After getting a response from the developer I would change my rating to 0 stars if possible. These guys hide behind confusing and opaque terms and refuse to budge at all. I'm so annoyed that my money has been lost to them! Really terrible customer experience. Original: Be very careful when signing up for a free trial of this app. If you happen to go over they automatically charge you for a full years subscription and refuse to refund. Terrible customer experience and the app is just OK.,negative
1,Used it for a fair amount of time without any problems. Suddenly then asked me to create an account or log using Google or FB. I used my Google one only to discover everything was gone!,negative
2,Your app sucks now!!!!! Used to be good but now doesn't update until I physically open it up and then close it then scroll and then it finally shows what I want to put on the list!!!!!! And I FRIGGEN paid for this garbage!!!!!!!,negative
3,"It seems OK, but very basic. Recurring tasks need some work to be actually useful. For example, it would be nice to be able to set a task to be recurring on the first of every month, without only being able to set that up on the first of the month. Edit; I also just noticed that there is no dark theme. Both may be available as paid for options, but I'll never know, since they are basic options and without them, I have no reason to try this app, and thus will never pay for actual premium options.",negative
4,Absolutely worthless. This app runs a prohibitively clunky interface that effectively voids the promise of ease-of-life automation. Google Calendar will provide all other services promised by Any do for free with no annual subscription rate. Don't sign up for the free trial. It's not worth getting pinged for forty bucks when you decide you don't like it and forget to cancel it in time. Save your money!,negative
5,"BEWARE the trial period is a scam I've been using the free version for a while and decided to try the premium for 7 days per the trial ad. After 5 days I realized it didn't quite organize my information how I best work so I wrote to cancel. They informed me that I must have accidentally signed up for a non trial and by their strict Terms cannot refund me. So I wrote back nicely that my intention was to try it per the Ad, but they said it's not possible. Really?",negative
6,"DON'T BUY PREMIUM! You have to pay for an entire year upfront. And If you change your mind about the app, like I did, due to its odd inconsistent behavior with reaccuring tasks and reminders. You're given 48 hours after the 7 day trial to qualify for a refund. After that you're screwed. All most all of the issues started happening after that period ended. They obviously know they have problems with the app, just read their robotic responses to issues. ANY.DO HIDES BEHIND TOS INSTEAD OF HELPING",negative
7,"This could be an awesome app. It has great potential except for a few flaws that end up making it a super irritating app. I have reported these issues to the app's tech support several times only to get lame responses with no resolutions. The latest being that when items are entered into a category in this app, the app for some reason resorts the sequence of items in my list automatically. I put these items in the list in a certain order for a reason. I have other issues, but no moreroomher",negative
8,"The app felt good enough for me to buy the yearly subscription, which I did and paid th 15€ it requested. But a week later they charged me 17 more euros to my credit card for the same subscription and the same features so I basically paid 32€ . THAT is a scam and unless I get my 17€ euros back I'm gonna keep the rating at one star.",negative
9,I downloaded it and login with Google I never did anything just logged in with Google. It has asking me many time for auto debit for subscription so I uninstalled it. But still 5 min before Rs 909 debited from my account. This is the muging of money. I want refund my money in my account. Kindly,negative
10,"This App is useless , it works as a notepad with your tasks in it , it does not notify you of tasks you suppose to do. When the time reaches it's silent doesn't pop up even though settings have permitted it to pop up and alert , even a simple alarm clock notified me of what to do .This app Doesn't work .",negative
11,Really disappointed to find recurring tasks functionality is only available with the paid version. Would not recommend. Also it doesn't sort tasks by date and time properly.,negative
12,Loaded the trial then emailed about cancelation but email bounced back. Ended up paying $36 for an app I didn't want. No way to contact for refund. Be careful if you buy this. If you try the trial you're stuck paying for it!,negative
13,"Cant re-edit time that ive set, necessary to delete and redo the process. Also, i need a reminder for every hour, and had to create 24 reminders instead of 1 reminder running every hour. Poorly designed.",negative
14,"Thanks to the developer for your quick response, however, this calendar is useless for our group without those features...we decided to go with Business Calendar Pro. Previous comments: Wasn't able to see month or year view",negative
15,"This was originally a 5 star app, but now you can only use it by allowing it access to either your emails or Facebook! 😡😡😡 I am definitely not happy to allow this so have deleted the app. Would give it zero stars if I could.",negative
16,Couldn't even set up one single recurring reminder without being required to pay monthly subscription. Get your greedy hand off it dev. It's only only a reminder app not a useful service.,negative
17,"Hey ,there is something wrong here ...the billing i signed up for was for about 2$ And not 35$ from my account...that is my tuition upkeep fee....I berely even use your app even.... please I need back my refund...this isn't right...I would file a report to Google play store..this is totally scammy... Please you guys should totally avoid this app please. Jesus Christ i totally expected to be billed 2$...all of a sudden its 35$...no this is totally far frm being fair please",negative
18,"I reported about this app due to incorrect billing but noone answer me. Please, return my money back because app took my money without my permission from my credit card.",negative
19,The fact that you have to pay so much to use something so simple isn't worth it to me. There are free apps of similar functionality.,negative
20,Need premium level to import wunderlist. B.S. Have to reset password Everytime to login. So haven't been able to even try the APP.,negative
21,Can't use it without registering with your email address. Immediate uninstall.,negative
22,"complicated , dislike the pro version. microft to -do list is better",negative
23,Not close to do list. All features available bin premium mode only.,negative
24,"It slow down my flow when i turned on or click via home page widget There is a fade in effect or lagging, please kindly help check Thank you",negative
25,Looked at it and it appears that the apps is signed as a subscription. Trying to find out if it is subscriped or not. Do not want the app.,negative
26,This app would not let me start a new day. It listed my tasks that I performed for one day as overdue for the next day. Just weird.,negative
27,No month view?? How hard is it to find a decent calendar with a whole month view,negative
28,"Just basic app without any exciting features. Why I pay for this useless app. Please don't download it's a cheat, waste of time and energy.",negative
29,"Would have been nice to know the price before using up my data for download, just to be uninstalled seconds later",negative
30,"Absolute rubbish, killing off Wunderlist for this is a clear example of the domanant power of the big thugs Microsoft, Google, Amazon etc., taking over better competitors so they can push their inferior garbage. Trying out TickTock now",negative
31,Deducted my money for no reason. I used the service once and then never used it. Return my money immediately.,negative
32,"Keeps failing to repeat some daily tasks. I've had to remake the same tasks several times because they just won't stick for some reason. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. It's a complete gamble. Now it's more work just to figure out what tasks need done than it is to do the tasks themselves. Uninstalling. This app is more maintenance than my daily chores.",negative
33,Just they copied GOOGLE CALENDAR and Charging On Top of That ... Google Calendar so far BETTER ...,negative
34,Premium support has not contacted me for 3 days and counting......,negative
35,All I want is a calendar. This app spams you so much. 1 star,negative
36,"Free version is very limited, and there are thousands of similar free apps that do what the paid one does. Dev likes to argue this but the app is really not very useful unless you buy a monthly subscription. Changed from 2 to 1 star for developer being actively misleading about this.",negative
37,Not free! You will be billed without you knowing about the loss of your money.,negative
38,"Worst app for premium, only yearly pay of rs 990. No option for monthly payment. Bad app.",negative
39,It looked good but it doesn't work. I scheduled simple tasks and it would change the timing. I re corrected to make it right several times. The navigation was difficult. Like I'd want to set a task but then I'd have to say the task was complete so wouldn't be sure it saved. Couldn't just back out to see the task was set correctly. Had to confirm the task was done then undo the task for later which might then change the time to something I never set. 😳,negative
40,"I have used this app for months on a daily basis, and was finding it really useful. However the app recently forced me to do an update and all my tasks were deleted as a result, as were the specific categories I set up. I tried deleting the app fully and redownloading it to see if that helped but my tasks still didn't reappear, even though my diary is syncing OK. I have lost over 80 tasks and can't remember all the info included in each task. It has shaken my faith in using the app again, particularly as I haven't received a response to the message I sent the team via the support link several days ago now.",negative
41,"I really wanted to love this app. It does exactly what I need. Unfortunately it's riddled with bugs. Mostly with repeat tasks. Main one being. If your phone is powered off at a reminder time, it will break the reminder. Resetting the task brings more issues. Also takes 15min for the app to sync with the widget! Contacted ""priority support"" (one reply a day). Seems to have no real interest in fixing the problems. Blamed it on Nova Launcher. Same thing happens with Samsung launcher.",negative
42,No custom notification sounds??? Really?,negative
43,"Used to be my go-to for my shopping list but 2 updates later it's become frustrating and wasteful. As I'm going through my saved items in each category to add it back to my list, the category just randomly closes and now I have to reopen it. Before I could just run down the list and click on what I needed to add.",negative
44,"Nothing but problems with this app. First smart lists didn't work, magically they started working the next morning and I thought everything was great. Now Alexa sync stopped working. It was working, then it stopped. It would sync to alexa if i added through Any.do, but not if added through alexa voice. in my efforts to fix it i disabled the skill and now i cant get it to re-enable. what a mess.",negative
45,"A subscription for an App that simple? Are you insane? It should be a one time payment no more, around 3-4$. This is my advice to you, you won't last long with this kind of strategy...",negative
46,Any app that ignores your phone's dark mode unless you pay for it is garbage.,negative
47,"This app seems useful. Regretfully, I am going to uninstall it. It is too pushy, and keeps reminding me to use it. That is not my only issue with this app. A day or so ago, I found that it had put itself on my lock screen. I did not put it there. I specifically put the transit app on my lock screen. I changed it back, thinking I am uninstalling if this happens again. It happened again. This morning I noticed it changed back to Any.do in the place where I want the transit app. Goodbye Any.do.",negative
48,"I like when this developers claim their apps are free, wait 95% free?! You mean 5% free, if even. Data costs money, stop pretending this crappy apps are free. For an note app, this one is nothing but INVASIVE.",negative
49,"I get it you want me to upgrade, not even tried the app and you shove it in my face. I don't like at all how it's all just promoting your pro version Delete your account it wants your password for your Gmail account this is a privacy breach also. So many things wrong with this app and their ethos. None of the integrations work unless you pay them. Totally money grab these guys as I've read elsewhere. I've deleted it now, it made me feel they have been so intrusive with what they are doing",negative
50,"I have used this app on my previous android and it offers awesome features. However, it's not working at all on installing on my new android Redmi Note 5. I have used this app before and I want this to be working at any cost. Pls help me to resolve this. App does not launch next morning as it should do. After I add my tasks, it just doesn't launch.",negative
51,"Why does it require sign up? Edit: in response to the reply, it is ridiculous that I couldn't even try the app before providing you with my details. I've now found a wonderful app that allows me to skip the sign up unless I wish to sync etc. I'll be sticking with that app because it is perfect and I only need to provide the info I wish to.",negative
52,Couldn't find Google Assistant integration anywhere. Even though it's been advertised everywhere when searching the web for the app. Edit: It's even in the description of the app here. That's false advertising. I will edit my review when it's out of Beta and working in the final version.,negative
53,Horribly simplistic. I found AFTER I had paid for premium that there is NO way to change the due date on an existing task. Renders the program useless!! Lacks other core functionalities...but I would NEVER EVER have conceived that the due date on an existing task cannot be changed. I was ripped off.,negative
54,Waste of time failed to pair with mu gmail account...gave up after 5 attempts,negative
55,Upgraded and lost all my tasks from previous version ... very disappointed!!!,negative
56,"This app requires users to create an account with either FB or Gmail to use it, then you find yourself in a 7 day free trial in order to pay later. Not encouraging to even try it. At least inform users that's it's not free before asking access to their FB or Gmail accounts.",negative
57,"Do not download this app!!!! I unsubscribed from Premium before they could charge me because I decided I couldn't afford it (I'm a broke college student). They took my money anyway! I tried to contact them; they don't have a number to call, so I emailed them. They told my they didn't charge me at all! I asked them to give me the contact info of their financer so that I could send them my bank statement, and they ignored my emails. They STOLE my money!!! Don't use this app, it is not worth it.",negative
58,Do not download this app if you want to keep money in your account- they took an unauthorized almost $40 out of my account. Their help page says they offer refunds within 48 hours however they offer no access to claim a refund.,negative
59,Won't stop charging me after cancellation. When it happened again this year after they promised one year ago that they would stop. I had to actually cancel the credit card. Upon reading the reviews I find that I am not the only one with this excessive billing issue.,negative
60,"Free, but wants you to pay before using. Social media not required, but wants you to register before using. Popular company, popular enough to remove my last 1 star review and send me an Email disputing it. Plenty of better note taking apps exist. I highly advise against this invasive app.",negative
61,Not user friendly. Directly asking for money.i already uninstalled,negative
62,Keeps notify me only sound without any notifications or any tasks and every time i open the app i got a pop up window with an old task that i finished already before along time ago. What is matter ?? It was a good app !,negative
63,Tech support is so vague with their pricing. I'm sorry but you just lost an interested customer. Cancelled trial and any plans of subscribing to premium.,negative
64,"Bad experience with the subscription, they refuse to give back the months I haven't used after canceling. Just want the yearly subscription. The Mac app crashes / gets stuck.",negative
65,"Wow, completely annoying. Trying to get you to buy premium on ever page. So much for trying it out.",negative
66,Installed and started setup. EVERYTHING I INSTALLED THIS FOR REQURED A SUBSCRIPTION. ONLY INSTALL IF YOU WANT TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING. IT probably should be stated that ALL the good points of this app require a SUBSCRIPTION. I AM NOW UNINSTALLING THIS APP.,negative
67,"Used to like it, but now the shopping basket is missing and I can't make a grocery list anymore. Very annoying.",negative
68,"Shity app. On top of that I subscribed for monthly and they charge me the while year. And when I cancel my subscription , no return policy. My Google reminder app is millions time better.",negative
69,I hate apps that try to trick you into subscribing. Be transparent about the conditions of use. For that alone I uninstalled this app straight away.,negative
70,Deceptive billing practices - information on cancelling is circular; emailed a link that advises to email. Doesn't have colour tag functionality across web and app; very poor UX and worse customer service.,negative
71,I have canceled for the subscription when at the first time i used anydo.  Do i still have to pay? i was try for free trial for the first i using this app.,negative
72,You are replying its free app but in every Option it shows you can get access to this tool after purchasing.,negative
73,"This app used to be good, but now the recurring reminder time changes everyday to the time you completed the task.",negative
74,"Unusable without an account. Even when I'm not interested in any of the ""cloud"" features",negative
75,"I've feel deceived by this app. There's no assistant, the whatsapp integration doesn't work also. I contacted support and got no answer. I'm cancelling my subscription.",negative
76,The premium version is advertised at R32 per year but if you tap it it changes to R300 odd. What's up with that?,negative
77,Downloaded the app...uninstalled within the 5 days they offer you for free. Now I noticed they charged me a full year subscription of 900+ INR. What a sneaky way to generate revenue....,negative
78,I never knew you could have a Callender planner bug you so mutch it will definitely remind you of things and does not stop. Not interested at all...,negative
79,Very bad app not able to close my account . They are forcefully charging amount.,negative
80,I'm using One plus 7 android 10. Alarm reminder doesn't work at all.,negative
81,VERY DISAPPOINTING. COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY! Now I add notes to a daily repeating calendar event! FREE AND EASY,negative
82,"i purchsed for one month and try to integrate with Whatsapp, its not working at all and even not able to click resend for OTP",negative
83,"Cannot link with other Google products, such as Keep Notes. The tags function forces user to upgrade.",negative
84,Ensure you read the comments re: payment. Every critical comment is true and this app just isn't worth what you're charged. I recommend you beware.,negative
85,"The font is too small for me to read, with no way to change it.",negative
86,Not able to set reminder of am . By default it is 'pm' and not able to select 'am',negative
87,7 day trail but you have to fill all or card details and take subscription worst trick,negative
88,Hi. App states its free. Yet there is a charge after 7 days. Dont mislead people,negative
89,How can I pay such an amount just for a to do list app. I'm uninstalling it now (5 mins after installation),negative
90,Will not work without connecting to an account.,negative
91,I hope the calendar inside can keep the completed to-do list history.,negative
92,"Immediately wants me to buy the full version of the app, while the demo part is not even that nice",negative
93,"This is not a multi-protocol task manager as the description false implies. This is a front end to their service. I couldn't get past the first screen because it requires me to set up an account to sync. I use a private server capable of syncing things like tasks, Exchange. Most public clouds (Google, iCloud, Office365, email providers) have this capability, therefore why should I need to send my data elsewhere if it's already on a server. The fact that data is not something you can touch doesn't make it less valuable. Be mindful of it, it *is* our most valuable asset today, it may not be tangible but it sure can be quantified endlessly. Requiring signing up for any app is a huge red flag.",negative
94,I had a premium. Scam.The app is very pushy and annoying. I couldn't get into 80% of my incoming calls as it blocked the screen so the call doesn't appear on the screen. You only hear it and hopelessly looking for the call screen that you only get once the call is dropped. You have to call back then. Disturbing and annoying. I barely used this app as to maintain it takes a lot of time. I asked them to cancel they said they will not refund as more than 48h passed of yearly(!) subscription.,negative
95,"It doesnt offer anything that I cant do on my google calendar. At least not in the free version. I'm not going to pay for an app that is basically just going to import my google calendar, when I can do the same things with google for free. Also, I saw another review where they have deleted reviews, which is shady. If this gets deleted, I'll look into the legal laws governing false advertising.",negative
96,Cant change default theme to black ! It asks to change me plan from free to premium before doing so !!,negative
97,I am unable to subscribe app payment method declined,negative
98,"Theres always something shifty to me about an app that shouldnt need a subscription for doing the absolute minimum. They make setting reminders too complicated and they're hoping you forget to end your free trial before they start doing automatic payments, that's just how most of these apps work. You're better off setting an alarm on your phones clock and having that on repeat than you are using this.",negative
99,Manage subscription is not given in the app menu,negative
100,"Disappointed, cant plan the same task over multiple days. Manually adding same task to repeat each day is a downside. Uninstalled.",negative
101,Ok,negative
102,Update: After getting a response from the developer I would change my rating to 0 stars if possible. These guys hide behind confusing and opaque terms and refuse to budge at all.

103,Can't get it to finish installing and I have plenty if room. Gets to 97% and then stops. I will revise my review if I ever get to try it!,negative
104,"Stop charging people for things that are simple. Just use OneNote. Buy a great planner on Amazon, copy the template and save your money.",negative
105,Used it for a fair amount of time without any problems. Suddenly then asked me to create an account or log using Google or FB. I used my Google one only to discover everything was gone!,negative

200,It doesn't sync up with Google Tasks. Not worth the change. Zapier does not work for Android. Zapier only works if you pay the Premium fee plus it only gives the option to add new tasks and complete tasks when integrating with Google Tasks.

The only thing more annoying than constant notifications from apps is at 9am when my phone vibrates and Any.Do takes over the whole screen and asks me to plan my day. I don't need it taking over things, i will plan when i want. Are you seriously doing this? It is the equivalent of a browser popup and very annoying.",negative
215,I had made an account for this app a long time ago but didn't use it for long and I forgot why until I re-downloaded it today. This is one of those apps that's incredibly frustrating because a lot of the main advertised features are behind a pay wall and/or you have to make an ADDITIONAL ACCOUNT FOR. Paying more than $1/mo for a list app is ridiculous. If anything it should be a one-time purchase.,negative

It syncs... kind of... so I can verify the two accounts are talking... just not well at all. When I use Wunderlist or Google Tasks or just Alexa by itself, the changes are instantly viewable across all platforms. The only reason I downloaded with app was to give me more control over my Alexa lists (which for some insane reason you cannot reorder). The extremely lag in syncing Any.do with Alexa renders this app useless. The UI looks really nice and user friendly, so I bumped it up to 2 stars.",negative

They claim what they used to do is not possible but that is not true because another app I use (Daylio) has a nice notification that jumps out at you, like Any.do used to. Now Any.do gives a regular ignorable notification which you click and the app does something on the screen and is pretty pathetic, THEN it gives it's notification to plan your day.

250,"Only rated 2 stars because of the ability to sync with the calendar apps on the phone and the ability to cross out any tasks once finished. However, the app is fairly simple with tasks laid out like a shopping or to do list with the inability to edit the timings of tasks.

Also, it would have been nice for the tasks to be laid out in calendar format with color-coding options.",negative

To me that's just a bunch of clutter. Then it was telling me I had five appointments this month, no, only have one, it only showed the one but it still says 5. I don't have a clue what the other four are. Anytime I try to do anyting it practically begged me to join premium, I just uninstalled it.",negative

Is a paid-only app with temporary free access to its full features that gets practically useless after the 7-day trial. If you can get past that sort of business practice to actually try it I think the app may be great, but I don't like to be lied to. Edit: I opted for TicTic after some experiments.",negative

262,"Just trying it out. Seems like a great app but has a really, really basic miss that I saw referenced in another review: Theres no intuitive way to specify or change the time of a task. Tasks are all just all automatically set for 9 am and theres not visable button or option to change the time. The other user mentioned trying to use Google to figure out how. But such a basic miss seems like a flag that maybe I should try a different app.",negative
263,"It's very confusing. I got the calendar app that was suggested to me when I wanted to use the widget, but once I started using the calendar along with any.do the tasks notifications got duplicated. I don't see the point of having any.do when the calendar app does the same thing.",negative
264,Premium version is too much expensive. Any.do should provide an option in which we can select max. 3 to 5 apps for integration in premium version & pay accordingly.,negative
265,"It's a mess. I add new tasks and tag them. But they will randomly disappear, reappear. And the tags will disappear. Editing and adding them back in doesn't help because once a tag disappears you can't add it back in again. Disappearing tasks is the worst because there's no warning. They're just gone. They're not listed as complete, they just disappear. Sometimes they'll come back but sometimes I have to re-enter them...assuming I remember. I pay for this app, so the fact that the basic functionality of keeping my list intact is random and spotty is unacceptable. It may have something to do with syncing... no idea. But either way, I'm going to use another app because I just don't trust it anymore. These errors seem to be recent, like in the last 3 months.",negative

268,App not bad but very limited unless you pay. Downloaded this app after reading in the news about it's WhatsApp integration. That is only available if you pay. Without the paid for aspects this application is like any other generic calender app.,negative

I have to click on each task for the the date to appear. In addition, I usually organize each task by tags, the date, recurring if needed, and other details. There's no easy way to adjust all these details anymore. You have to click on each separate icon to fix these to what you want. I use the app begrudgingly.",negative

273,"At first I thought 'wow this can do everything! It's exactly what I need.' When I downloaded it and got to test it out, I noticed the features I needed the most were on premium. I'm fine with that, but only if premium was a one time payment. Not monthly payments for a membership. Monthly payments are for bills, taxes, video subscriptions, vpns, maybe even online storage subscriptions, but most definitely not calendars or to do lists. Those should stay as free or a small one time payment.",negative
274,"This is a nicely made app and premium is cheap, but one critical flaw is the reminder sound runs through the ringtone channel instead of the alarm channel, or even the media channel. So unless you enjoy hearing every single notification go off on your phone or your ears are super sensitive to vibrations from across the room this app is not fit for purpose. A shame I just pooched my free trial now",negative
275,"I really liked the app for its simplicity. That changed tremendously with the recent updates. For example, it now takes me 10 clicks to postpone a single task! People use To Do apps to improve their efficiency, but this app isn't efficient anymore at all. I hope the simplicity comes back with future updates...",negative
276,"This is a good app with somewhat helpful widgets. The widget calendar should include tasks on individual days. Events and their notification settings are lacking. If I want to be notified 2 weeks in advance, I simply can't.. In Google Calender, I can set it 4 weeks in advance. With this app I have to set the event date 1 week before it happens and set the notification to 1 week in advance in order to get 2 week notice. These restrictions are a dealbreaker.",negative

Now it doesn't sync properly with my smartwatch -- ticking tasks off on my watch no longer marks them complete on my phone. Also, the widget is broken now, and doesn't reflect changes I've made unless I restart my phone. I sent a support request to the help team, but have gotten total radio silence. If they don't fix it, I'm cancelling my subscription. Right now it's not worth paying for.",negative
278,"I find the app inflexible and buggy, with a counter intuitive UI. How to delete or rename tags was not obvious. Using the back button would often exit the app at unusual times. After adding a new tag the app wouldn't allow me to do anything until I exited and restarted. Plus, the premium features seem more like essential features, to me. Looking for an alternative app as we speak.",negative
279,"Frustrated that all the useful features are only for premium. not complaining that they are set up that way, but that they dont let you know until you are set up. Also its calendar wont work unless you import an external calendar? defeats the purpose of having a separate calendar. without premium its identical to a hundred other free apps.",negative
280,"I had hope for this Calendar app but apparently in order to see the calendar in a normal format as to the list format, you have to pay a premium, & that is not what I want to do. I'm very disappointed uninstalling & will be looking for another calendar app. All in all it seams like a good calender app but just not for me.",negative
281,"Once the app reinstalled itself and I lost everything. I still have no idea why it did this. Also, it often doesn't open when I first tap the icon. If I tap it multiple times it eventually opens within a particular task. I found it frustrating and I've now uninstalled it. It would be a great app if some of these bugs could be resolved.",negative
282,"Nawww, sorry your yearly subscription price scared me off. By the time I've subscribed to every app I consider helpful I'm spending waaay too much. I would have liked it but I have other much more important bills to pay. The low stars is due to the price and there's no point in coming back to justify it because it'll still be too much for me. Edit: I know that I can use it for free, but then I'd still have to put up with ads. Surprisingly I don't like ads. I still consider your sub too much.",negative
283,"The app would work great; if it only reminded you when you wanted it too... What I mean is, it would certainly remind me of my scheduled tasks. That great!

I don't even dream to have a habit/statistical section, but THERE HAS TO BE A WAY TO SKIP OR FAIL THE REPEATABLE TASK. Now I only can delete it, but is is not representative way. 2. There has to be a way to exclude a list from the ""all tasks"" list. For example I have list with books to read and films to watch. A lot of tasks, that look bad in the ""all tasks"" list, I loose real important ""no date"" tasks because of it. You redirect me to your uservoice, but according to it excluding list from ""all tasks"" list has been ""in roadmap"" for 2 years, don't think you really care and your uservoice makes any difference. I know that adding habit tracker might be a heavy feature, but failing the task, or skipping it? Hell no. As well as excluding lists feature, it's also an easy one. But two years? Meh.

286,i had installed the trial version but did not use and it was of no use at my end. to my surprise i see today getting an sms from vodafone to be charged Rs.1028 for one year subscription. i contacted vodafone and they told me to delete .the app within 48hrs of installation which i did. pl cancel this subscription as its of no use to me so that this charges could be credited back by vodafone to me. Developer - pl refund back my money as i dont use it.,negative
287,"It constantly crashes and misses a lot of functionality. Hard to use and annoys with some popups that can be discarded only by closing app and then opening it again and permanent noticfaction that CAN'T be disabled. Payd 30 euro for this and used for month before it got so annoying that I started to look for another app. Fortunately I found one - Todoist. It's unbelievable how much better that is. Also there is version of todoist for PC, for your smart watch and even as browser extension which allows you to easily set a certain web page as task. And all these are synced.",negative
288,Loved this app until I recently realized that i dont use it half as much.It all started w/ a major update.If you click to put a task for tomorrow the calendar will still put you on the date of?So u then have to change it to tomorrow.THEN you have to go through not one but possibly 2-3 steps to tell it a time?On an analog clock?Its 2019 who still uses analog clocks? One step for the hour another for the minutes and ANOTHER for am/pm.& if u mess up thats it u have to start over. Too many steps,negative
289,"***UPDATE 5/29/19 - I decided to go ahead & do the trial so I could see how the location reminder works. So far I've tried about 3 different locations & none of them have updated. One of them was even my home. This was about 30 mins ago! I've been waiting for the app to work with Google Assistant. It's been saying""coming soon"" for quite some time. When this happens I may consider doing the premium. Until then the 7 day trial is pointless to see how the service completely works. Maybe one day...😥",negative

I don't mind paying for premium features as long as it is a one-time payment, the whole SAAS model is annoying.",negative
291,"The concept is good but the execution lacks. There are constant issues with server sync, and since the server side has priority, updates I make on the phone regularly get wiped out.

When I use Wunderlist or Google Tasks or just Alexa by itself, the changes are instantly viewable across all platforms. The only reason I downloaded with app was to give me more control over my Alexa lists (which for some insane reason you cannot reorder). The extremely lag in syncing Any.do with Alexa renders this app useless. The UI looks really nice and user friendly, so I bumped it up to 2 stars.",negative

I hope that you can do something about this. Anyway, thank you for helping me get through my daily tasks.I'll wait for another update",neutral
421,"Some nice features here. Their approach really set it apart from the other I've tried so far. It's a strong contender as a Wunderlist replacement. The only reason I am still not confident on a switch is their Wear integration. It's terrible! The app doesn't listen to the watch at all. I've tried completing and snoozing and it does nothing. The watch app can only add tasks, so the screenshots they're sharing here are DECEPTIVE. I also wish I could hide completed task, instead of deleting.",neutral
422,"Honestly I would give it 5 star, since I'm not going to subscribe or anything, but the fact that you need to subscribe just to change the theme (just to change it into dark theme) is deal-breaker, so 3 star it is.

423,Stop looking at users as cash cows. I will be uninstalling this and moving to a different app which is as good and does not nag. This is quite a good To Do app other than that it too often comes up with prompts to upgrade to the premium subscription-based version. Since when have customers disrespectfully/greedily been treated as cash cows. It used to be apps were$5 at most for a lifetime of use but now they are greedy and arrogant enough to want $5 or thereabouts per Month! I wud pay a one off,neutral

If you want and work with advanced GTD, planners, project management go away and dont lose your time.",neutral

462,"Eh, it wasn't for me. Maybe it's because I was using the free version, I didn't think this app was very intuitive at all. First of all, it's very annoying to not be able to set my own reminder times for tasks. I had the option to either choose 9 in the morning or 6 in the evening. What the heck? Secondly, the reminder feature goes off a little too often. Only one reminder is needed. I know I could have turned notifications off, but I did want reminders for my tasks. I should have been able to control the number of reminders. Also, it was pretty lame that I couldn't make multiple lists. I was just dissatisfied overall with my limited options. I deleted and am using another to do list app",neutral
463,"I had an older version of this app on my previous phone and loved it. However, the usability has gone way down somewhere in between.... You need to get rid of the analog clock thing when adding reminders. It takes way too many finger taps than is necessary to set a simple reminder for a given task, and annoyingly resets to the current day and time every time you try to edit a reminder you have created. This is confusing and makes it hard to use this app on-the-go, which is when I need it most..",neutral
464,"Overall, I like the app. However, I'm uninstalling because of the pop-up notification that goes over other apps and basically freezes my phone until i dismiss it. The app doesn't have permission to draw over other apps and no way to disable this notification. The only reason it isn't 1 star is because overall the app is good.. they just ruin it with that 'feature'.",neutral

A grocery list I didn't even want replicated itself 12 times.  My personal list replicated itself 13 times and when I deleted the second to last iteration of this it deleted everything I had ever typed into my lists.  Calendar support only available on ipad and android phone, not in browser window.  You have to trick the system into puting a date on items by setting a reminder and then going back in to deactivate the reminder.  I like that you can move items around however you want and that items left undone today stay in the today category instead of just floating out of the system.  It is odd that something as unfinished as this emerges as king of the hill in this category.  I would have thought that the global creativity and intelligence of humanity would have far surpassed this but apparently not.",neutral

It's like you put it on your agenda and it just doesn't disappear after it's over it just keeps on repeating very annoying sad that I paid the full subscription amount thinking it would help me to stay focused with my work day, but only for a few days until it started repeating itself and I tried to find a way to cancel or delete something out of the agenda completely",neutral

The most glaring issue is that you are confined to the app's predetermined reminder intervals. you have NO option to create your own time intervals (i.e. 12 hours before, 18 hours before, 4 days,5 days before, etc.). They say this app is customizable, as long as it's the developers choice of customizations. look elsewhere if you want total customization. I'll look for more deficiencies and report back.",neutral

Basically, it was as simple as making a list on a piece of paper, with the added bonus of having reminders. Now, however, it requires more steps to add to-dos, and is becoming more of a complicated app, loosing the original appeal.

For example you can set reoccuring events, but peoples schedules alternate. Would be great to be able to click the days you work group then at the same time and categorize them under work.

It has been sporadic and may not keep a reminder posted even when it hasn't been marked complete. 3. The format for setting a reminder day is clunky.

491,"Excellent app, with plenty of functionality for free users and worthy upgrades for paid users. I love that it can be used across multiple platforms. That being said, it's super unreliable so I'd never upgrade. Repeated tasks sometimes get marked off and stay on the current day, needing to be marked completed as many as 5-7x before moving to the next day.

Time to shop for a new to-do list app.",neutral
514,I'm giving this app 3 out 5 because there is a really annoying behaviour when you're adding a quick note and if you by mistake tap outside the text box (which one would do on the go) your note is erased and you need to start again. I'm considering uninstalling it because this happens almost every time I add a note which means that it takes me twice the time. Please at least keep the text and don't erase it in case of an accidental tap outside the box. Thanks,neutral
515,Simple and effective! although charging for color themes is ridiculous. I understand getting charged for the other add ons but color shouldn't be extra! The widgets are white and black see thru which makes it hard for me to see. little dots aren't helpful.,neutral
516,"I already have a subscription, it's ridiculous that It notices I already had a free trial so it obviously knows my account but its not logging me in with my premium subscription. To top it off I can't ask customer service nothing because it's not an option unless you have the premium that's ridiculous.",neutral
517,"New User experience just logged in. pretty simple. started a list. saw that you could categorize them as personal or work. since i had typed all my tasks in the same place (first experience landing). i tried to move some of these tasks to the ""work"" section. couldn't. i can't tag them either. i have to retype the whole thing! Bummer.",neutral
518,"I used to like this app, it is simple and easy to use. but lately it keeps deleting subtasks, or not saving correctly, so I go back to do thing I needed help remembering, it to find it gone. it also could be a lot easier to add a reminder notification",neutral
519,"App looks great. UI is wonderful and the feature it have , they all are useful. Only problem because of which I uninstalled the app was simple and basic features like recurring task creations are made premium. Switching to tick tick for the same reason.",neutral
520,"Nice app overall! It does what it promises. I have two issues with this. 1. The widget seem broken. Previously, when I click on the task and mark as complete. Now it takes me to the task management page and there is no way to mark that as complete from there. I have to open the app to do that. 2. There is no way to sort tasks based on date. As a user, when I open a task list, I should see all tasks that are coming up so I can plan accordingly . I have to manually do that when I mark as complete.",neutral
521,"I don't know why this app is an ""Editor's choice"" there isn't any special graphics and you need to be a premium to change a color. Keep Google give me all this for free! I was just looking for a different to-do list where I could change the size of the letters.",neutral
522,"Great for daily list. Used to use the grocery list. Used to. Had to turn it off due to spam. If it continues, I'll uninstall the app. UPDATE/CLARIFY: IMO, spam is getting items added to my grocery list that I don't want & never buy. It was the app telling me ""we've added XYZ to your grocery list""",neutral
523,Please can we go back to entering the time with numbers. The clock thing is fiddly and pointless. It seemd your developers don't have enough work. Also when I select this evening I have to select the date before messing with the time which makes no sense.,neutral
524,This app refuses to let you set a reminder for any day other than the current day without buying premium. i want to remind myself to workout every Wednesday but it's monday so I'm only allowed to schedule reminders on Monday. Guess I'll just get reminded on monday to workout on Wednesday. Useless,neutral
525,"Notifications are annoying and not customizable (was getting them for not having any tasks for the day). I turned off notifications via my android settings and am still getting impossible to turn off pop up notification that blocks whatever app I am on. App is fine otherwise, but not for me.",neutral
526,A good app but does not show full month tasks and that makes it hard to plan ahead or look back to previous events,neutral
527,The task add bar blocks the list if it's too long with no way to scroll down. Also would like an option to have completed tasks to disappear not just sit there crossed out taking up space.

532,"Missing basics Clearing the completed tasks is like erasing history. Instead of having the completed task stack up and encumber the whiteboard, each one of thr completed tasks should appear on the calendar (as completed or as initiated on /completed on, in Gantt chart format) This is really basic guys",neutral
533,Great feature is reminder to reorganize missed and undone tasks. But ui of the app looks confusing to me. I cat find a way to add tasks easyly enought gor me. i dont know what next. google tasks are simplier and todoist have limited features in free version.,neutral
534,"I'm new to using Any.do, so I'm still really unfamiliar with the app. I'm so far finding that the free version is quite limited... I wanted to try the free version before doing the free trial for the premium, to compare the differences. The main point I'm unhappy with, is the fact that the reminders don't make any noise, so if you're not looking at your phone, you never realize you're getting a reminder. Is there a way in the free version to put a sound to the reminders?",neutral
535,it's a great app but I'm not sure about the security and privacy of it. I like apps that mention in the description itself stating that they don't collect data from users. a little info on that would be nice to see in the description thanks,neutral

539,Any.do is great for list. But the calander app lacks. They have a new plan your day feature but the times dont show up next to the task on the calander. so not sure why you would bother scheduling task. I think Im going to find an app that allows list and an hpurly daily planner.,neutral
540,It's almost perfect. The widgets on homescreen need more options. A list of events for the day instead of only the monthly view is a necessity. Add it and I'm sold!,neutral

542,I accepted a 14 day free trial but changed my mind just straight away. How do I cancel? I go into my subscriptions in Google play but I do not find this app among my subscriotions. I suppose it will turn up there only when the 14days free trial is over. Pleas confirm how to cancel. Thanks//,neutral
543,"Has many nice features but they lack polish - 1. Has notifications like TickTick but unlike TickTick, you'll have to unlock the phone for you to see it. 2. Has a grocery list where you can add things but you cannot add quantity.. And many others...",neutral
544,The app was reccomended by my CBT therapy group but I do shift work and it's not friendly for those with rotating schedules. Great for 9-5rs who have single event tasks or those who tasks always repeat at the same tone each week or month. I need my tasks to repeat on a 4 week cycle and it ended up giving me all my tasks together each week.,neutral
545,Needs premium subscription for dark mode. That is so greedy. Dark mode is a basic requirement in 2019. Charging for different themes is understandable but for dark mode? Edit: i have uninstalled your app for the moment. Thank you for your consideration. I'll change my ratings from 1 to 3 for now.,neutral
546,Is just me or did this app kind of just get more complicated after the last update? I'm not sure what it is about it now that I don't appreciate but I really liked the last version much better... It seems too simplistic and it's still buggy...,neutral

559,Full of promise but the lack of word wrapping means task detail is hidden. Particularly bad for sub tasks where the font is also larger and therefore exacerbates the issue. If and when this is resolved I'll be able to use the app and give a more balanced appraisal.,neutral

661,I love the app But its shame that I can't add my tasks on my calendar after I planned my day. I am heavy calendar user I use it to schedule every hour of my day but I can't do anything similar with this app except to remind me at certsin time. To me having to see how your day is structured by the hours is really usefull. Uninstalling it for this reason.😏,neutral

669,"Some nice features here. Their approach really set it apart from the other I've tried so far. It's a strong contender as a Wunderlist replacement. The only reason I am still not confident on a switch is their Wear integration. It's terrible! The app doesn't listen to the watch at all. I've tried completing and snoozing and it does nothing. The watch app can only add tasks, so the screenshots they're sharing here are DECEPTIVE. I also wish I could hide completed task, instead of deleting.",neutral

671,Great app but crazy there's no Google Calendar integration!! Even tried setting this up with Zapier but it only creates an entry (with no link to any.do task title) for when the task is created and not when the task is scheduled. Will Google Calendar integration be coming to the app?,neutral

It's a bit hassle that it was made smaller that without my glasses I didn't notice it for several times. Also,I don't see any purpose of sharing it to other people ;so it should not be the priority.

685,"Much better since my last review in 2015. Right now, easily the best to-do app out there. All the issues I faced back then, are gone. One thing that makes this a 4-star (above average) app rather than 3 (average), is the automatic inclusion of past-due tasks in Today-list. Of course, if it's past due, it has to be due today. Somehow most to-do apps miss this. 5-stars will be when(or if) they actually release the google assistant integration and it actually works without issues. That Zapier-stuff, though.... what a joke. If anyone has the time to deal with that, they have plenty of extra time and have no need for a to-do app. Also, including zapier as a premium feature, with zapier itself requiring an expensive subscription to actually work, is a pretty damn dick move. Yea, just thought about this again, and this dick move costs 1 star. Pay $10 for a 1 star extra DLC!",neutral

709,Needs premium subscription for dark mode. That is so greedy. Dark mode is a basic requirement in 2019. Charging for different themes is understandable but for dark mode? Edit: i have uninstalled your app for the moment. Thank you for your consideration. I'll change my ratings from 1 to 3 for now.,neutral
710,I'm giving this app 3 out 5 because there is a really annoying behaviour when you're adding a quick note and if you by mistake tap outside the text box (which one would do on the go) your note is erased and you need to start again. I'm considering uninstalling it because this happens almost every time I add a note which means that it takes me twice the time. Please at least keep the text and don't erase it in case of an accidental tap outside the box. Thanks,neutral
711,The app was reccomended by my CBT therapy group but I do shift work and it's not friendly for those with rotating schedules. Great for 9-5rs who have single event tasks or those who tasks always repeat at the same tone each week or month. I need my tasks to repeat on a 4 week cycle and it ended up giving me all my tasks together each week.,neutral
712,"Excellent app, with plenty of functionality for free users and worthy upgrades for paid users. I love that it can be used across multiple platforms. That being said, it's super unreliable so I'd never upgrade. Repeated tasks sometimes get marked off and stay on the current day, needing to be marked completed as many as 5-7x before moving to the next day. Sometimes when you add a task it'll disappear; maybe related to server syncing. But not always, so you better remember (defeats the purpose)!",neutral

It has been sporadic and may not keep a reminder posted even when it hasn't been marked complete. 3. The format for setting a reminder day is clunky. Recurring reminders are especially difficult and may not even be available (for example, there is no way to set a recurring reminder to every 6 months).",neutral

805,"After testing the app for a while, I was ready to purchase it but read on your user guide that searching for tasks is not available on Android. Do you know when it would be available? Also, is there a one time fee purchase option? Is there a GMAIL integration feature? Like Google Tasks? I like the minimalist simplistic clean look of your app 👍. Nice work on the Widgets 👍. Thanks 🙂",positive
806,"this app is just simply awesome 👌 just one thing I missed was notification sound, it won't ring when a task is due, as a result I won't be able to know about the task if I ain't using my phone.",positive
807,"Very good app, it's simple yet you can add layers to your tasks. My only issue is that, you need to pay for some features that are important for executing your tasks.",positive
808,"Super good! But the Any.do Moment no longer pops up on my new Pixel 3a, which is the only reason I use this. It is enabled but only shows up in notifications, no popup. How do I get this working again?",positive
809,"Awesome app, I love it! Simple and great reminder systems! One big thing is missing though: family calender: shared calender with family members (incisive kids without the app/phone/e-mail) and option to organise event and tasks for other familymembers.",positive
810,Reminder popups are not displaying at the bottom of my screen on my new Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra. They only appear in the notification area at the top of screen. Is this an Android 10 issue? How do I get the popups again? It worked fine on my Samsung Galaxy S8+,positive
811,"This application which I used thoroughly, and this application seriously deserves 5 stars ✨. I have given 4 stars because it don't have multiple user merged account in it. Which helps our 4 members of family to write their to-do in a single place.",positive
812,I'm using the app couple of years and i really nice. It just really annoying when the reminder message pops up while you type a message or during the call (while hanging up...),positive
813,"Needs an easier way to switch from other task apps, specifically common ones such as Google Tasks. Please add the functionality to import tasks, lists, reminders and events by logging in with a Google account.",positive
814,It's very simple to use you can make your list easily and remind your tasks at the moment. Thank's,positive
815,Awesome app very helpful and does its purpose very well. Just wish it was free or a one time purchase.,positive
816,App services are very best. But its very expensive. When i tap for subscribe yearly subscription google say your limit cross.,positive
817,Money hungry devs want about $5/mo for simple features... That's about $60/year for the fully functional organizer app. Other than that it seems nice so far.,positive
818,"Widget not working correctly. when updating the date of task to future date, it still shows in today task",positive
819,It is exelent! Sometimes a little buggy when deleting some tasks that are daily,positive
820,This platform very good platform Anything planning Just used to any do,positive
821,"Good application, its better if synchronisation time can be improved",positive
822,Add how long it takes to do a task instead of what time I should do the task,positive
823,"Perfect except for one thing. The 'I want to...' button at the bottom of my to do list sometimes blocks the bottom item on my list, making it more difficult to cross off. There is already an add item button on each list category, so I think it should be removed or users should be given an option to remove it.",positive
824,"The ideal task mamager for me! Perfect combination of ability to customize tasks, design and great for team work. Still would be better if tasks added to My lists wouldn't automatically add to all tasks where Today, Tomorrow etc sections are. Sometimes I need them to keep in my lists and not be added to lists with some time attachment:) If possible, I am your fan forever !",positive
825,Nice but cost too much yearly to buy.,positive
826,Good but have to pay for many of the features,positive
827,"I love the to do lists with simple and useful style and features, but the calendar is lacking a bit. You should be able to change events color. Would be nice to have independent notes, instead of notes in each task, if it had that, the app would be the best organizer.",positive
828,"Prefering this over Google Calendar. There is still an annoying bug where I cant edit/delete events added to the calendar externally (through a gym app, for example). Pressing ""edit"" then it just goes back to the calendar view instead of to editing",positive
829,"Links to my Amazon alexa and very useful, I hated typing stuff in but now I can just ask Alexa to add stuff to my to do and shopping lists I really like it. There was nothing wrong with it before, I just don't like typing much!",positive
830,"LIKES ~Free; The possibility of arranging the tasks list in my own order with a simple clic ans scroll, and having it in that order as home screen widget; The possibility of having the events list widget just next to the tasks list widget. The events list also show the tasks and this seemingly appears like the rare feature of an events list and tasks list integrated on one screen. DISLIKES But it would be better if the tasks kept my prioritisation order even when they appear in the events list.",positive
831,"Great app for planning. The missing 5th star is because the reminders are restricted, and not personalizable. If you want to be reminded at a specific hour of the day, you can't.",positive
832,Helpfull apps but it would be great if there is search feature,positive
833,You should keep recurring tasks for free. That is the only reason I left using your app four years ago and started to use google keep. Everything else is great.,positive
834,"I'm enjoying the user interface. It's has a nice aesthetic and more importantly has pretty much everything I need for putting down my tasks. However, the widget keeps freezing on my home page, and my completed tasks for a particular day don't show up in the app for that day.",positive
835,"Overall good and useful. I'll likely continue to use, and.. .. . ..I would like more control of reminder sounds including repeating (so i don't miss it) and sounds without needing to open app. (maybe there are settings i can adjust). also more integration with other apps including Trello and Evernote and more a general multi app share feature would be great. As is i am copying and reentering things in multiple apps, and i want to just send them.",positive
836,"The app itself is great and I don't mind that there's a paid premium version. In fact I think that's a great idea, but I don't want to have to pay a subscription for a simple list app. I'd absolutely pay a generous one time price for it because the app is worth it, but I don't care for another subscription. I'll have to stick with the free version",positive
837,"App UI is very good. When I see my today tasks, I see all the tasks. But I only want to see my today tasks list(like todo list app). Need another feature mean automatically overdue notification when I cannot complete my today which tasks. I know that your reply, but i think it's actually perfect example on todo.list.",positive
838,Only had a couple of days and generally good experience. Ties in nicely with Google Assistant though I cant get it to automatically set a time to remind on a task when created by voice. Slight niggle that when I do certain actions completing events the app jumps to mid july on the calendar; no clue why but it's pretty irritating Overall seems to be helpful for productivity,positive
839,I want to love this more but I’m not heaps impressed that dark mode is free and native on iOS but not on Android. I use my devices a lot later at night and it would really help if this app would keep the dark theme the rest of my apps generally manage to keep. It’s also the one constant notification that annoys the pants off me as it is bright white against the dark screen.,positive
840,Love this app. I use it daily and it's an important part of my planning. The only thing I think would make it 5 star to me personally would be the ability to create seperate lists so that I can have 1 personal widget and 1 work widget. At the moment I can only create widgets using the same list.,positive
841,"Love the organization so far. Super easy to use even in comparison to other apps like this. Would make one change, I would like to be able to click on a specific, individual time/date block on the single day, 3 day, week calendar set up to add a specific event/task to THAT individual date/time block",positive
842,Very nice app. It could use some more work. But I like the color tags and the plan your day feature.,positive
843,Becoming undispensable very fast...,positive
844,Repetition should not be a premium function,positive
845,Loving this- the only addition I would have is being able to view highlighted tasks and events on the calender,positive
846,It's an excellent app very helpful I have one problem with it.. That I couldn't easily copy tasks from one day to another.. If there is an easy way to do it please help me,positive
847,"The calendar widget cannot follow up with today date, it just fixed at the date that created the widget only. Hopefully can fix this problem",positive
848,Good app. But it needs to have tasks accepted from Google calender,positive
849,How to change letter style. Can't read sub titles with double lines!,positive
850,"Its a great app, although it only allows me to connect to amazon alexa, and not any other assistant.",positive
851,"Smooth and simple UI. Devs could make setting an alarm for tasks even simpler with less taps, since I use reminders at specific times for each task.",positive
852,Easy to use and I love the daily prompts to get things done! Even when I have not scheduled anything,positive
853,Make more advanced settings for paid subscription not the color of the theme.,positive
854,"This is great! Help ful, I get a lot more done now. I love this. It's a great app.",positive
855,Good app so far. Only problem is that there are some events that dont give me the delete option. Why is that?,positive
856,"Not always reminder message pop up , sometimes missing time or day.",positive
857,It seems to be a good wonderlist option. Good notifications and i enjoy having the full calendar available.,positive
858,Amazingly good experience that lets you manage and plan your days ahead and let's you take some time for yourself out of the haphazard schedule.,positive
859,Beautifully done...love the features,positive
860,Very helpful and detailed app...love it!,positive
861,No ads that's nice,positive
862,"Long time user of this app, problem is it doesn't have a search feature. Or if it does I can't find it. Sometimes I forget where I filed my note or task (again longtime user) and then it takes me a while to go through all my files to figure out which title heading I put it under, but if it had a search feature I could quickly find it and get back to being productive. For this reason I gave it 4 stars because it has room for improvement.",positive
863,"Good app, but many paid services",positive
864,Helpful for my day to day tasks. Still using free version,positive
865,Great way to stay organized,positive
866,Easy to use smart and flexible options,positive
867,"I use this for my honey-do, hardware store, and movies lists",positive
868,"I love this app and I am so glad that I have found it. I wish I had found it sooner, then I wouldn't have wasted my money on other apps! The only things I would like improved is: - preview of the tasks in the tags and my list view. - the box view for the tags to be colour coded. Instead of the text, the whole box is in the chosen colour. - Quicker synchronisation with windows Keep up the great work!",positive
869,Very helpful for me to list out my works,positive
870,"Updated review based on developer reply: Sadly not for me. For example you can't 1) turn off vibration when reordering tasks, 2) quickly select multiple tasks to assign labels, 3) view a list sorted by label/tag, 4) add priority to tasks, only labels which you cannot use for sorting the list.",positive
871,"Very clear app to use! -> Please add a widget with dark background (now there are only light and dark transparant) -> Would also be nice to have a possibility to make a task that can only be checked if other task is done (i know there are subtask possibities, but there are not so clear how to use then and they are not being showen in the main windows untill you open the parent task)",positive
872,"This is a good app...Requesting you to add some more options . 1. One is SORTING for all tasks by Date, by Alphabet etc. 2. And the second option is to add SEARCH option for finding out any task which we already added. 3. The task on the bottom end is not visible because of the ADD Button. Please correct it",positive
873,"It's a very good App, just that sometimes it doesn't open like it's frozen. I then have to go force it to stop then try again to open it.",positive
874,Good. Works offline so I love that. But one improvement they must include is to allow us to have a hierarchy in projects. Else it is too cluttered,positive
875,"Very happy with this app, exactly what I needed. Just 1 issue, if I put a repeating reminder for any task, it works (rings/notifies) only on the first day and nothing after that. Please fix this.",positive
876,"Tagging could be a much better experience. Doesn't support display by tags in Mac and desktop apps. There's got to be a way to snooze in bulk. Should have an option to disable getting alerts for calendar entry, already too many of them.",positive
877,"It's okay, I just really hope it would let you do more for free! I know it's 95% free, but I like to repeat some tasks for a week, I am not saying it is bad, It's an excellent app!",positive
878,It a great app. Repeating tasks are great when its chores that you only do once in a while. And sub tasks can actually be helpful too. The reason i give it 4 stars is because priorites in tasks come in a very tacked on way,positive
879,"I really love this app. I find myself wanting to make tasks for myself about it. It has an incredibly clean UI and feels great to use. The only issue I have with it is the pricing model for the pro version. For 5 or 6- admittedly useful- features, there's a monthly subscription. Which personally I find to be ludicrous. I'd willingly pay a one time charge, but a monthly payment is just silly for this app.",positive
880,"I LOVED this app because it has a calendar and to-do list in one go. I can categorize my tasks and put subtasks below. But when I recently updated the app, no radio button to tick off for the subtasks. I handle a lot of tasks categorized. Plus the notes below the subtasks is not there anymore. You need to add more clicks. It was easy and organized. Now, in uninstalling. So sad, i thought I have found the app. Was about to go Premium to get the full benefits but uninstalling. 😢",positive
881,"I used to love this (five stars) before you changed it. I was able to set repeatable tasks for each day of the week, but now if I set a repeating task today, for example, for every Wednesday, the reminder will come up today, not Wednesday. I want the reminder on the day I want. I am very disappointed. By the way, I won't use Any Do for my grocery list. I use a better one that keeps a running cost (including tax) for each store I go to.",positive
882,"It's a great app, it has this option to connect to Amazon Alexa, which is great, but I wish there was the option of connecting to Google assistant. Otherwise it would have gotten 5 stars.",positive
883,Would give 5 stars if it wasn't buggy and didn't cause me to miss a task. The calendar widget is a complete failure. It randomly removes some of the calendars that are synced and creates a duplicate of repeated tasks when they are marked as complete. The whole reason I subscribed to this app was because I needed to sync all my calendars and make my life easier by maintaining them all in one place and not miss any appointments or tasks. The app is useless if I can't rely on it to display and sync correctly. Fix the bugs and I'll reinstall and change to 5 stars.,positive
884,"Confused. I'm not sure what happened and I'm glad I didn't have a long grocery list because I just had to transfer everything from my ""Grocery List"" to a new one so it would open like a normal list and not as a pop up. I don't understand why y'all thought that was a good idea but whatever. I've clicked everything I can think to click. ""Convert to regular list"" isn't an option that I've seen anywhere. Is that only in premium?",positive
885,It's very good. Moved off Wunderlist since Microsoft is forcing a MS account and will eventually get rid of it. It's not as good as Wunderlist which I miss but it's very good so using this moving forward.,positive
886,Great App gets my day well organized. But I can't easily search for items in the list. I have to scan through all items one after the other. Takes time,positive
887,"It's a GREAT app. 4 Stars because I think one addition would be a way to have 2 identical widgets running without being connected. Like 1 widget set for my daily goals tasks (shower, laundry, gym), and the second widget for tasks I update and add throughout the day (pick up milk, get haircut)! That way i don't get overwhelmed by a single long list but instead have 2 smaller lists. I'm a ""one screen all widgets"" guy. Another addition would possibly be a widget calendar list, instead of having the 30 day calendar + each days events. Seems useless to have such a huge window of calendar days when I really just need to have a list of events of each day. Samsung calendar has this widget and it's perfect.",positive
888,"Very good for scheduling, making tasks and sorting your day, considerably better than Google calendar, but there is a part of the app that you have to buy. Works fine without buying, I use it on a daily basis",positive
889,Loving this app so far. My only concern is that it does not highlight the current date on the calender when I open the app if there are no tasks/events for that day. This can be confusing. Another concern is that the calender does not indicate whether there are tasks/events for particular days by showing tiny dots next to the date.,positive
890,"Useful program. Could be the center of my daily activities. Would be better-smoother, more integration with Gmail and Google Calendar with, again, better, easy, even default--'scheduled follow-ups' on same screen--Category, Priority, Time/Date. No less important, drag and drop tasks onto other Categorical Tasks to create a Categorical Hierarchy based on Time/Date/Priority-Level in the Task. Then, instantly shows in Google Calendar with a simple, mouse-over 'Zoom-to-Task' in the Calendar.",positive
891,"Real nice app. I like links to google calendar for events, reminders. Not sure about tasks. Have you guys thought about drag and drop between tasks and events? It'd be perfect for time blocking or scheduling tasks. Right now I use a zapier that takes new tasks in a specific list and lists them as 5 am on today's calendar. I'd like to drag them to certain times so my schedule doesn't fill up (shows time blocks as busy in Calendar). Thanks",positive
892,"This app is just great, it not only reminds me what I need to do, it really motivates me to do stuff. the only problem I'm facing, whenever I try to mark a task as completed, the task crashes, and then it updates and actually shown as completed, except this annoying bug, I love it.",positive
893,I really like this application. It's super simple. Two things I want - schedule upcoming tasks in my calendar and do meal planning as well in it.,positive
894,All it needs is Google Calendar integration. Edit: Oh wait it does have it! I was using the Any.do Chrome Extension (the little pop out thing) when writing this review. The Any.do Chrome Extension does not have the ability to display Google Calendar events alongside one's Any.do tasks whereas the Any.do Android app does indeed have it. AFAIK. It doesn't have IFTTT applets but I'd return if it made some.,positive
895,The app is really amazing. It helps me plan my day ahead and it's super convenient because it plays u whatever that have been planned on the day like a recap moment. Thanks :),positive
896,"meh, doesn't have dark mode (easier on the eyes) that's the one thing that breaks it for me",positive
897,"I like the ease of creating different to do lists, ability to create subtasks, and that i can make my grocery shopping list according to what store I shop at. It's great that the grocery list are automatically sorted by aisle for you. However, i noticed that if i add a price to the beginning or end of the grocery item, that it gets put in the 'other' aisle category. I also like how you can switch something in one list to a different one just by tapping on it. Nice work 👍",positive
898,"1 week in. not bad. somewhat intuituve. I like this app so far for its thoughtful blend of simplicity and intuitive features that go beyond being a task list, & more into routine habits. some important features are hard to find or change after initial set up. my day planning activity 'anydo.moment': I could not find all week to modify... So, it was starting this important step at a difficult time of day to use. Many simmilar apps aim & claim to be useful but only achieve novelty.",positive
899,"As someone with ADHD, organizational tools are a necessity and this is one of the best. I say that having tried just about every well rated organizational app in the app store. That said, this is obviously still in development. The web version is missing many important aspects. However new features are coming out regularly and the team is very responsive. Once a few more features are up to par (namely the website and the smart lists) I'll be changing this to a 5 star reveiw and paying for pro.",positive

My only request would be to give me greater control over when events repeat than the current setup of every day, week, 2 weeks, etc. (E.g. Allow me to repeat events on weekdays or even better specific days. Like Mondays and Wednesdays for instance.) Otherwise the app is sublime.

There is already an add item button on each list category, so I think it should be removed or users should be given an option to remove it.",positive
971,Very helpful and detailed app...love it!,positive
972,"I love the to do lists with simple and useful style and features, but the calendar is lacking a bit. You should be able to change events color. Would be nice to have independent notes, instead of notes in each task, if it had that, the app would be the best organizer.",positive
973,Calendar widget has a glitch when you edit event to repeat it changes the day to a day before example I put my mom's bday on jan 15 all day event and saved then went back in to edit repeat every year and it changed it to jan 14,positive
974,"It's okay, I just really hope it would let you do more for free! I know it's 95% free, but I like to repeat some tasks for a week, I am not saying it is bad, It's an excellent app!",positive
975,Great to do app,positive
976,Excellent!,positive
977,I'm waiting for it's Windows app :/,positive
978,Very nice app. It could use some more work. But I like the color tags and the plan your day feature.,positive
979,You should keep recurring tasks for free. That is the only reason I left using your app four years ago and started to use google keep. Everything else is great.,positive
980,"so cliche! first u make people addicted to something, then u put a price on it. not all the countries have the possibility to purchase. Please add Hijri Shamsi to any.do's calendar. The Christian month names and other calendar features are not any recognizable for we persians using shamsi calendar month names",positive
981,Good,positive
982,"It's a very good App, just that sometimes it doesn't open like it's frozen. I then have to go force it to stop then try again to open it.",positive
983,I really like it,positive
984,"Great app for planning. The missing 5th star is because the reminders are restricted, and not personalizable. If you want to be reminded at a specific hour of the day, you can't.",positive
985,"Good app, but many paid services",positive
986,Works lovely,positive
987,"Prefering this over Google Calendar. There is still an annoying bug where I cant edit/delete events added to the calendar externally (through a gym app, for example). Pressing ""edit"" then it just goes back to the calendar view instead of to editing",positive
988,Good app. But it needs to have tasks accepted from Google calender,positive
989,Good,positive
990,could have more types of priorities,positive
991,"Thank you for the prompt response. I've been using any.do for years and will be continuing to do so 😀. I like some features available with the premium option, but I'm not a subscription person... Still, I haven't seen any app to beat any.do 💙",positive
992,"Love the organization so far. Super easy to use even in comparison to other apps like this. Would make one change, I would like to be able to click on a specific, individual time/date block on the single day, 3 day, week calendar set up to add a specific event/task to THAT individual date/time block",positive
993,"Overall good and useful. I'll likely continue to use, and.. .. . ..I would like more control of reminder sounds including repeating (so i don't miss it) and sounds without needing to open app. (maybe there are settings i can adjust). also more integration with other apps including Trello and Evernote and more a general multi app share feature would be great. As is i am copying and reentering things in multiple apps, and i want to just send them.",positive
994,Only had a couple of days and generally good experience. Ties in nicely with Google Assistant though I cant get it to automatically set a time to remind on a task when created by voice. Slight niggle that when I do certain actions completing events the app jumps to mid july on the calendar; no clue why but it's pretty irritating Overall seems to be helpful for productivity,positive
995,Ok so far.,positive
996,Its a good app,positive
997,Nice one,positive
998,Good app,positive
999,"I'm enjoying the user interface. It's has a nice aesthetic and more importantly has pretty much everything I need for putting down my tasks. However, the widget keeps freezing on my home page, and my completed tasks for a particular day don't show up in the app for that day.",positive
1000,"Update: Thank you for the info! It does what I want:) I have been using this app for about a month. I was excited to see I can separate my to-do list into today, tomorrow, someday etc., as this feature I use to prioritise tasks, which is what I really wanted from the app. Unfortunately it keeps moving all the tasks back into today, which makes it kind of pointless to separate them in the first place :( Please fix this or I'm on the hunt for another to-do list organizer.)",positive
1001,Great App! I'm a heavy hitter when it comes to looking for something wrong with an app and I will be blunt. So far no complaints. The app runs smoothly. There are a lot of great features for the free version. WHAT WOULD SET THIS APP OVER THE TOP FOR ME. WOULD BE THE ABILITY TO MOVE TASK TO ANOTHER TOPIC. BOOM 🤯 .Hope this review helps you in best way possible. Let me know what you think 🤔 ?,positive
1002,"Since Microsoft scrapped ""Wunderlist"" for ""Microsoft To-Do"" which is a significant downgrade, I had to look for an alternative. I can't believe that I found something that not only gave me back everything I lost from switching to ""To-Do"" but is actually a major improvement. Highly recommended.",positive
1003,"This is the best productivity app I have ever used and I'll keep using it. It is so simple and intuitive, with useful reminders that keep you on track. The only option that is missing in my opinion is to set alarms (not only reminders) for tasks that can go on few hours before, other than that it's 5 stars all day long! Thanks guys.",positive
1004,"I'm kind of a geek....I like planners. I used to try out lots of different physical planners, then switched to trying out lots of planner apps. This is my current favorite. I love that it integrates with my calendars and that I can put specific times on my to-do tasks if I want....makes it so I can look at their calendar view and see all of my meetings AND my tasks based on when I'm planning to do them. I like being able to quickly schedule tasks, snooze tasks, schedule recurring tasks, etc.",positive
1005,Using the free app works for what I need. It helps me put down my thoughts of what I need to get done later when they pop into my head. When I have the time later I check it and see all the things I normally forget about and get them done. Sometimes the reminders are annoying and I'm sure they're a way to turn them off but they do remind me to check out what I've out down.,positive
1006,"I love the fact this integrates with WhatsApp, I use it for work and personal it make thing so much easier!",positive
1007,"Wildly impressed at how much this has helped me to continue to get more organized in life as a whole, not personally and at work, its inexpensive for the subscription and can do so many things, most of which I have yet to tap in to, I feel so much more in control as this keeps everything in front of me and I k ow what I have to do and when",positive
1008,I started using any do when I was very unorganized and had too much stuff in my head. I used the 7-Day trial and got everything out on paper with all of the different kinds of things I had to do and it was all included in any do which was perfect so I signed up for a year everything from doctors to paying bills and making a grocery list! I've never had a problem it's wonderful.,positive
1009,"It took 5 different apps to find this one. Everyone lacked in some major way. Be it reminders, the interface, or the way it was organized. THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST! Lacking: Occurrences option is limited to one one occurance on Andriod, need more, grouping lists under a single name (aka, history, math, science under ""School""), for things to be arranged by time with unschulded things at bottom of ""today"" or ""tomorrow"" columns to schedule later. And importance/urgency ratings on tasks. AMAZIN APP",positive
1010,"Love hate relationship. The app is great.. It nags and nags and @*! @@! nags per your settings until you want to kill it.. Dead!! And then again! But it does its job. The reminders are rude, intrusive, nagging, annoying and constant but acheive your goal of reminding you to take care of things until you actually achieve items on your list. I HATE it.. But it's supreme for procrastinators, busy people, air heads, and anyone else who needs a keeper to keep them on target. Phone/setting dependent",positive
1011,"In my opinion, it is the best app for reminders and to do. I use it every day to plan and organize my day. Some features I constantly use are Google calendar integration, focus mode and priority tags. The interface is also very clean. Great work, Any.do team",positive
1012,"Clean interface. I liked the minimalistic design without much clutter. But have a question for team. I have added hundreds of tasks in a list. Now i want to edit a particular task. I could not figure out how to search that task , it is difficult to go through huge list.",positive
1013,"I love this app! It has helped me get organized and remember important things in a way that is so simple and easy! I have one request...can the developers make a widget for the ""lists"" so I can swipe easily to it on my home screen? Thanks!",positive
1014,One thing most apps lack is the calendar. This app has the list and calendar integrated into one. You can actually see your entire day of what you have to do in ONE APP. Great job guys. My #1 planning app so far.,positive
1015,"I have tried a LOT of these types of apps. HANDS DOWN ANY.DO is the best. Im terms of user friendliness, user experience, and what have you. Gonna buy and would recommend the same. Thank you Any.Do! My head is a lot less noisy now ☺️.",positive
1016,The app has a clean sharp interface and is easy to use. I appreciate having one app for my daily ToDo's and calendar needs. It also never unexpectedly quits on me.,positive
1017,I'm a novice free user and I use it primarily to set reminders. I love the way it pops up at the bottom of the screen and the display of the reminders. The design and user friendliness is super cool! It's been a wonderful experience so far and I highly recommend it!,positive
1018,"I have been using this app for years, I can make different lists, add reminders, and it's very easy to use... Love it!",positive
1019,"This is the best to do application I've ever used. I've tried a lot and I love the way this one breaks down the lists into today, tomorrow, upcoming and someday. I would definitely recommend it.",positive
1020,Does what it says and well ave doesn't try to be anything else. Easy interface to use. I have been using this for years and never had any issues and recently upgraded to premium.,positive
1021,User friendly interface with voice commands ...thats the best feature However It still takes time to add a task by voice as We have to use GUI for time and date reminder Can i somehow Set by default : priority to high and reminder to repeat with alarm,positive
1022,Really helpful app to keep track of my to do list. It is nice to have an app that is very organized. And I can keep it separated from my other things. Great App and better than any app I have tried. A++++,positive
1023,"I like I can have a list of my assignments to do and even create grocery lists and it sections it off automatically. Once done, I just simple cross out what was completed. No issues after using for about 2 weeks.",positive
1024,"I have loved the past 2 days of using the free version and, coupled with ""focus"" mode on my phone, the past 2 days have been super productive. Thank you!",positive
1025,"Happy!!! I just found out this amazing app. I love devs from Israel, not discriminating others tho. But I have a thing about calendar view. It shows different month other than the current month, same with the today's date, it shows other dates hmmm...maybe I clicked or touch something? Help!",positive
1026,"Love it. Downloaded it and deleted it over the years, and everytime I get it back I get so amazed at the amazing new features. It helps me straighten up my life. Thank you.",positive
1027,"Super app! Great layout makes it better for planning than using a standard calendar. Recurring tasks function clears so much unnecessary mental clutter, freeing up neurons to work on more passionate pursuits.",positive

1032,"This is the very best app I've EVER used. If you are a lists person, ANY.DO is a must have, so easy to use, tons of feature, but as simple as you need it to be.",positive
1033,Bough the premium subscription for 37 AUD. Worth every penny. Made a top firm list of things I need to sort out this week. Was wondering where to start for past couple hours. Checked out Google. Creating a group for myself in whatsapp to remind. Astonightly undoubtedly worthy. New whatsapp integrations let's you to be reminded whenever you set it to. Chartbots to the win!,positive

1035,I really appreciate the format of this one. I just wish I could color code without paying extra.,positive

If you ever care to reference completed tasks in any structure this app is not for you. It's a hot mess now for that. And their backups do not include completed tasks.

Still no Kanban view, no native calendar view, limited to no sorting options, just to name a few.

Maybe the fatal flaw of this app is that it has too many features for its own good. I'd like to get rid of sync entirely and just use the app on my Android, but apparently that can't be done, and if I delete my online account I delete everything.

I don't mind waiting for it to get fixed, but I might just start looking for a new app, which sucks because I really liked this one.",negative
1439,I would rate this app 5 stars except I hate the way it scrambles all your tasks every time you change time zones.

I really hope you guys are working to fix the lag, the lay out and the syncing problem. This last update was a terrible idea",negative
1600,"This app is ok. The thing that makes it stand out for me is that I've been able to set it up to work with Google Home as my grocery and to do list. However, since the update I now can't click into the full app from the widget, which is necessary as I'm unable to rearrange my tasks from the widget and I can't seem to find a way so that the app automatically sorts my tasks by 'priority'. I can only see how to do it afterwards.",neutral

1602,"I use Todoist every day and it is awesome service in general but the latest update to the widget made it absolutely unusable for me. It has too slim lines even without compact mode (compact is ridiculous, even though I have small fingers), the quick button to open the main app is gone and the WORST - it is now not possible to select more tasks and do anything quick with them. Bye bye fast rescheduling... I am greatly upset, it is my main tool for staying on track.",neutral
1603,"Generally pretty good, but a lot of awkward design choices: no compact mode, inefficient use of colors for organization, difficulty selecting and moving tasks, lack of icon consistency, preset snooze and reminder time options rather than being able to choose them yourself.",neutral
1604,Would be better if it was possible to add to the top of the list. It is not easy to use with one hand since everything is in the top left corner. Lists do not automatically sort and sort needs to be done again if anything is changed,neutral

The sections cannot be reordered to appear at the top of a list, the can only be at the end of a task list. 3. In filtered view, pulling subtasks out of their parent task or non-completable tasks is ludicrous. Duplicating them like that is silly at best.",neutral

I like enhancements to apps but sometimes, as in this case, fiddling with something which was already very good is likely to make it worse. Many of the new ""features"" make the app worse!",neutral
1622,"Excellent with a single exception. I've used Todoist for about 5 years and it's the best app in its class- the free version outperforms other paid apps in my experience. The one thing holding it back for me is the home screen widget. On my phone it struggles to load, lags, is unresponsive, won't select tasks properly,, the list may well go on- in short there are so many things which sometimes break, it rarely works. This is fundamental. 5 stars if fixed. Til then, it's a reluctant 3.",neutral

This should be as simple as changing the label. Please, be so kind to the users and fix this. .... Great app, does exactly what I need it to do. Extremely simplistic and elegant, yet functional design. I would tweak one little thing or too, but overall todoist is almost a perfect product.",neutral

Also it is now impossible to select amd edit in bulk. Poor consideration of basic use cases on part of developers and testers.",neutral
1627,"Why do you get rid of things after making users use to it?? What happened to the press and hold to multi select? Why can't I type 'tomorrow' and click backspace to remove the auto calendar add like I was able to before the update. Thanks for the new features but don't take out the old ones, or at least add an option in the settings to keep things the same",neutral
1628,Looks very appealing and has support on multiple platforms however having basic push notification for individual tasks behind a pay wall is pretty stupid and makes it the app untempting to switch to. I would reconsider if the paywall wasn't a subscription or rather have the reminders as a separate one time purchase.,neutral
1629,Repeating previous posts- don't bother with the free version if you cannot pay the premium. It's just a shell not worth the space it requires.,neutral

I just wish it can accomodate 6 people and the notes feature is available to use (it is a premium feature, but it would be nice if there is a character limit, as a compromise). The app supports syncing with calendars. But imo, a todoist calendar option will be better - no added step of linking and maintaining the other calendar's data integrity. All in all, this is an app with potential",neutral
1651,"I like the way this app is so intuitive to use but it has just been updated and there are dots that can be selected. Generally on websites these are used for options, you select one then do something with it but in Todoist when an option is selected it deletes that task. It is very confusing and counter-productive. Swiping the task was much more intuitive. I don't know why this has been changed when it worked fine as it was. As the saying goes, if it ain't broke don't fix it!",neutral
1652,"Very nice looking, the pricing is just right, and I love that you can have subtasks upon subtasks. But... almost nothing about it is intuitive. For an app that is all about helping the user be more productive, to have a new or occasional user blundering around poking and prodding until the app lets them accomplish basic tasks... well that is obviously detrimental to productivity and a surefire way to accidentally encourage customer churn. UX test your app please.",neutral
1653,"Overall i like this app and i am wondering if i should pay for the premium version, because there are serious limitations on the free one (no notes or labels)... But there is one thing that annoys me : the impossibly to control the view settings. It would be better if they had options to change the size of panels and size of fonts and smaller spacing between each entry. It would allow for a better overall view and/or permit to view more things at once and reduce wasted space of the left sidebar",neutral
1654,"They changed the priority colors, so that instead of a gradient, it now goes grey, blue, yellow, red. I don't think this is an improvement - it is not immediately apparent to me which priority blue is at a glance. They also took away the priority color strip on the left and replaced with a colored checkbox. It looks worse to me. I'm not sure this was necessary, just so that the user could close out a task with a single click.",neutral

1657,"Layout and appearance is good but main features like alarm, reminder etc are available only in premium version.",neutral
1658,This app seems great. However I switched to another app mainly because the reminder alarms and reoccurring task options are locked without premium. What the free version let's you do is fine but not impressive enough to risk a subscription billed annually. They should give a free premium preview for a week or two so this app can showcase itselbetterf. Without access to reminders it felt more like a note keeping app that i had to remember to check which hindered the promised productivity boost.,neutral
1659,"its a cool app, it really is, but developers need to understand that a subscription based system is not for every app. im fine paying a subscription fee to netflix, or Spotify because there is new content almost daily, but i refuse to pay a subscription fee for a todo list app. make a payed app, ill buy it for 30 bucks, what i wont is give you 3 bucks a month everymonth and add yet another subscription fee to my list",neutral

1941,"This app and Todoist Web are nice products, but they do have their issues: 1. It's hard to know what to expect from Todoist in the future. Updates and fixes take a very long time, and there is no public roadmap or issue/request voting system. 2. Todoist promotes itself as great for the GTD method, but it lacks core concepts like Next Actions, Waiting For, and Reviews. 3. The app refuses to start if you don't like Google Services (GSF) on your phone.",neutral

I don't use Todoist for long-term planning (I use my other task manager for that) or for important tasks or projects because Todoist simply is not built for actual projects although it refers to its lists as ""projects"". What Todoist and many users actually are wanting from Todoist is a task outliner close to MyLifeOrganized, Notion, Dynalist where projects exist within the task outline. Had to give it a three star ""Meh"" rating.",neutral

What is more troublesome are latest updates. For some reason they removed ability to customize start page. That's the feature I relied on day to day. They have also made mobile app LESS convenient to use. I am now afraid to complete tasks by accident due to change in app layout.",neutral
1949,UI is hard to understand,neutral
1950,Gotta be kidding me! I don't mind paying premium but not for adding notes to a task. No way. This feature is free on every one of the 100+ ToDo apps in Play. Other things should be charged for.,neutral
1951,Is this offline? Or can you use this even though your not connected to the internet?,neutral
1952,"**Update** After about 4years, I have grown frustrated with Todoist. The support team takes around a week to get back to premium members and almost ALWAYS w/ a generic ""thanks for your feedback but I'll say nothing tangible"" response, but 24hrs if you post publicly on Twitter - priorities seem to be off. Development has seriously plateaued. No significant features in a very long time. It seems like they are falling behind in the market.",neutral
1953,"Overall i like this app and i am wondering if i should pay for the premium version, because there are serious limitations on the free one (no notes or labels)... But there is one thing that annoys me : the impossibly to control the view settings. It would be better if they had options to change the size of panels and size of fonts and smaller spacing between each entry. It would allow for a better overall view and/or permit to view more things at once and reduce wasted space of the left sidebar",neutral
1954,"I really can't speak to the full experience, because I do not have the premium version, but so far the free version has helped me with keeping my projects and tasks in one place. I am still getting the hang of prioritizing, but that is more of a personal thing.",neutral
1955,This app seems great. However I switched to another app mainly because the reminder alarms and reoccurring task options are locked without premium. What the free version let's you do is fine but not impressive enough to risk a subscription billed annually. They should give a free premium preview for a week or two so this app can showcase itselbetterf. Without access to reminders it felt more like a note keeping app that i had to remember to check which hindered the promised productivity boost.,neutral
1956,"I've used Todoist for years and it's a fantastic app BUT I won't give it more stars unless they show sub-projects under the parent project again, like it is on desktop. **Edit**: I added one more star for having configurable swipe settings, which I really appreciate.

1958,Awesome,neutral
1959,good app,neutral

Well no one seems to like this feature, or at least there should be an option to either have subtasks or not, so hope you guys bring it back. Will use it then. Another observation- most of the top-notch features are unavailable to non-Premium users, and not many are willing to subscribe. Seems a bit unfair. One time payment would be great. Will that change?",neutral
1961,"It's good, but everytime I mark a task as completed on the widget I have to open the app and tell it to sort my tasks by date again. You guys should include a setting to choose how you want your tasks ordered and reorder them by that setting everytime. Cause it's annoying having them reorder themselves in a way I dislike constantly.",neutral
1962,"its a cool app, it really is, but developers need to understand that a subscription based system is not for every app. im fine paying a subscription fee to netflix, or Spotify because there is new content almost daily, but i refuse to pay a subscription fee for a todo list app. make a payed app, ill buy it for 30 bucks, what i wont is give you 3 bucks a month everymonth and add yet another subscription fee to my list",neutral

1967,"Good app. a lot of useful features. As a premium customer, I would like to have the ability to export to an excel or spreadsheet program for reporting purposes. Also, the app freezes a lot on Windows",neutral
1968,"I like the way this app is so intuitive to use but it has just been updated and there are dots that can be selected. Generally on websites these are used for options, you select one then do something with it but in Todoist when an option is selected it deletes that task. It is very confusing and counter-productive. Swiping the task was much more intuitive. I don't know why this has been changed when it worked fine as it was. As the saying goes, if it ain't broke don't fix it!",neutral
1969,"Widget seriously needs fixing. Screen real estate is important, and your widget is huge & wastes so much space. Please set up options for controlling text size in it & try to remove dead space, & the title of the app, since it's unnecessary.

For an app that is all about helping the user be more productive, to have a new or occasional user blundering around poking and prodding until the app lets them accomplish basic tasks... well that is obviously detrimental to productivity and a surefire way to accidentally encourage customer churn. UX test your app please.",neutral

1973,was nice using the app ...getting used to the interface,neutral
1974,I love the app but a possibility to put in task progress (0-100%) would be great! In the updated version when I select the filter 'view all' on my widget the subcategories are gone...

1975,very good,neutral
1976,"They changed the priority colors, so that instead of a gradient, it now goes grey, blue, yellow, red. I don't think this is an improvement - it is not immediately apparent to me which priority blue is at a glance. They also took away the priority color strip on the left and replaced with a colored checkbox. It looks worse to me. I'm not sure this was necessary, just so that the user could close out a task with a single click.",neutral
1977,A very helpful software especially in management work,neutral

1981,I don't understand why the changes I make in this app don't sync with Google Calendar. What am I missing?,neutral
1982,paid app,neutral
1983,Removed two stars because of the horrible checkboxes. Changing things like that without a option to disable is a disrespect to paying customers. [previous 5 star review] Recommended for anyone who wants the most feature filled to-do list. Tested a lot of them and this really stands out. You can adapt it to a lot of workflows and the new integrations made it even better!,neutral
1984,I dislike the update but mostly I dislike that it was changed and I had to look here to find out why. If you are going to change the core functionality of the app at least say so when I open it. I am greatly fighting my response to just uninstall out of frustration.,neutral
1985,Great app but please give an option to disable checkboxes. I hit them all the time by accident and there's no Undo on the widget :-(,neutral
1986,i hate the checkbox so much... Please make an option to remove them. Totally ruined the old nice swiping experience.,neutral
1987,"i dont like the new update. tapping the circle to finsish taps is not nearly as satisfactory as the swipe from before. more importantly however, this means i very easily mark tasks as done from the widget by accident as it only requires one tap now.

1995,sync between gcal was so bad that I wasted plenty of time waiting to add a single task. For almost half a year it worked fairly nice but that problems with sync today was enough to lose any trust for keeping important task on that platform,neutral

1998,still getting to grips with the app. I'm sure it's great.,neutral
1999,phone app is great and syncs well but windows app always jumbles my tasks so i would recommend using online app on your computer,neutral
2000,"It's a good app. It's pretty, minimalist and works really well. It just really bothers me that the ""undo"" (button that appears when you make a change) gets in the way of adding a new task and gets accidentally clicked, so I have to wait for it to go away. I would suggest for the developers to please take a look and see if you can adjust the placement of the buttons in this case. Thanks!",positive
2001,"The app is excellent; simple, streamlined, functional to-do list. However, the newly redesigned widget gives me a heck of a lot _less_ control. How do I select and reschedule a group of tasks? How do I open the app from the widget (so I don't need both the widget and an icon)? If I wanted to do complex editing, I could easily open the app, and the widget could do things the app couldn't.

2002,"By far and away the best of all the dozens of task manager apps I've tried using! So intuitive. Can't wait for the ""upcoming"" feature that's on the way. But gotta thumbs-down the new widget. No way to open the app straight from the widget so I removed the widget from my home screen all together.",positive
2003,By far this is the best to do list app I have used . But I have 2 issues with new widget. First :I can't press the icon and go to the app like I used to. The icon is gone now . And second: the font is too small .really hard to read my list .,positive
2004,"Great app! Easily share lists with others. Easy to add or check off items. One enhancement request would be to make another default view option the list of all projects, rather than having to choose one project to default view.",positive
2005,"I LOVE the new widget! It's finally useful! Please let us change the time when the day changes... For example, I go to bed at around 3AM. I consider any time before that to still be the technically previous day. That completely messes up tasks that repeat after completion...",positive
2006,"It's an overall great app but the problem is that it notifies all of the notifications once be it at 8AM or 10PM. If there was an option where tasks are pinned on notification untill you check them from app, I'd give it a 5 star",positive
2007,Straightforward solution for business and personal use in my cell and laptop. Sometimes I get a bit lost on how to get from granular details back to an overview of projects.,positive
2008,"Hi can I have an OPTION TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE NEW AND OLD DESIGNS OF THE WIDGET? The previous version was able to have larger boxes to fit long description tasks, while the new one just puts three dots and shortens the task descriptions to fit in one fixed width, which disables full reading of the task(bad). Also, subtasks cannot be seen WITHOUT CLICKING the main task, which kinda defeats the purpose(again) of having a todoist widget where i should be seeing the overview of everything. Thanks",positive
2009,"Good app, just wish you were able to back date a completed task so I can use it for tracking habits as well, but it's a to do list app and works well.",positive
2010,"The new widget is an improvement, but the fact that I can no longer open the app from the widget is IMMENSELY frustrating. It means I have to waste home screen space in the app icon, and isn't that what a widget is supposed to avoid?",positive
2011,"I have barely began using this app (less than 15 minutes) and I am already in love! The Terms you have to agree to alone are just so assuring and satisfying. Kudos developers, kudos!",positive
2012,It is a fantastic apps. But if they can allow the push reminder in the free version it will make it perfect.,positive
2013,"Please, make an option to use the old style widget. Unfortunartely letters became too small for 4x6 home screen grid.",positive
2014,Easy to use. I will however like to have a time boxing feature for my daily activities.,positive
2015,"Useful, efficient, and simple! While some people find the simplistic nature of the app as a downfall, I believe this is one of it's best features. I can make tasks with deadlines and make the subtasks have subtasks, meaning big projects are a lot more step by step and manageable. I've recommended this app to a few friends and would do the same thing for others, especially students!",positive
2016,"I've been using Todoist Premium for just over one year now. I think I've tried nearly every todo app out there. There has been some quirky behavior introduced over the last few months, especially around rescheduled occurrences of recurring tasks, and it's been a bit frustrating there. But overall, it's the best app for me and the team behind it seem like great people based on my interactions. Give it a shot!",positive
2017,"For me it takes a lot of additional actions to schedule a task and set the reminders. Even in free apps I can do it easier. For one task I've left comments from mobile phone, however I couldn't find then. They were only in the web version. Of cource there are things that I like: projects, subtasks, labels, reminders by location. And access from a mobile phone and a browser.",positive
2018,"Mostly a good app, helps me keep on top of things. Morning notifications are a bloody lifesaver. My only criticisms are that the free version is rather lacking in basic features, at least for people like me coming from other apps. Also the top bar and the system status bar when in the app are different colors, slightly, and that's always bugged me.",positive
2019,"I love this app. I tried many to do list apps but this is the one that meets my satisfaction, I guess? The basic features are good, just right. But I'll give it 4 stars since I'm still finding something I myself can't say and it's not here. Maybe it's in the premium version but I'm broke as hell and I can't afford to pay for it because I have other expenses. I do hope that some other features would someday be free, it'll be really helpful.",positive
2020,We use it for running our home & project improvements. It is easy to use.. not as user attractive as some but ok.,positive
2021,"Very nice working space, but the display of things can be a bit nicer.",positive
2022,The best app for to-do lists. It does have a couple of minor issues: * The widget can become unusable once in a while (stuck forever on the loading screen). * It can also take a couple of seconds for an item to be removed after you check it off on the widget.,positive
2023,"This is a great app, and I love it, bit I have two small issues with it. First, I don't like how insistent it is with notifying you to complete tasks. Second, I wish the interface had a better tutorial so that it would be easier to have the due dates and such easy to prepare when you enter the task in. Since fixing one would fix both, this is still a great app",positive
2024,"Love the app, but there is a bug in the current version of the app where ""next week"" actually schedules things for two weeks out. Actually scheduling in general in the app seems a little wonky. These are new issues as of a few weeks ago. Otherwise it would be 5 stars.",positive
2025,I really like this app. Getting to know all the little features that are included in the free version. It has helped me with my productivity as a sales professional and given me more control of task that need to be done daily to often get forgotten. I recommend this to anyone that find using a to do list helpful.,positive
2026,"I've been enjoying the app. I love how I can easily set recurring tasks. There's just one thing I wish I could change. I wish I could change the hour at which a new day begins. I know that sounds weird, but I am a night owl and usually don't go to bed until after midnight. Before I settle down for the night, I like to review my day and check off tasks that I forgot to check off earlier. But by the time I do that, it is technically a new day and the tasks are automatically marked overdue.",positive
2027,Hey guys the new update messed up the widget layout for me now everything is smaller and more difficult to read!,positive
2028,"Great app for the most part. Functionality is amazing. Sync is great. But, I really hate that this app puts itself on top of whatever I'm doing every 5 minutes exactly. Been through all the settings and turned all syncing off but no. Incredibly obnoxious on my tablet. Haven't had the same issue on my Android phone",positive
2029,"A bit inconvenient interface when adding and asigning date to the task. Other than that pretty cool intuitive UI along with minimalistic style. My first choice of todo app, even free version is good enough to keep your plans out of your head but in this app.",positive
2030,"You responded to but STILL DON'T understand my comment about repeating event scheduling. I KNOW that you can schedule repeating events, & I KNOW how to do that, but each repeating event is scheduled at intervals reliant on the original event date. What if I sometimes would like the event to repeat from the actual completion date? For example, I forget to renew my library books for a week. When I renew them finally l have 3 weeks before I need to review them again but your system says 2.",positive

2035,"Despite the unresponsive widget, overall a pretty decent app.",positive
2036,This app has helped me be productive with the amount of features it has. The only negative I would say is that I would have liked to see the reminders feature included for free,positive
2037,"Great app, good at keeping you accountable and productive. Would be nice to be able to re-order your to-dos though and set deadlines for when they have to be done",positive
2038,Paid experience is better than free. But it will do since there are no ads. UI and design can be made note clutter free.,positive
2039,"Im using the free app & enjoying it alot! Super easy to capture ideas and reminders when they pop into your head, before you forget!",positive
2040,"Great app to keep tight training schedules and regimes. Premium isnt necessary, only downfall would be reminders notifications more than once",positive
2041,It's the perfect kind of list I've tried. Everything is great. It could be better if we had a calendar view as well.,positive
2042,Seems almost perfect. I'm missing a monthly view feature of the tasks/assignments/etc.,positive
2043,The free option has all the features I need. An alarm would be nice but since I don't have the premium I'll do without for now.,positive
2044,Good app easy to use. I like the fact that it emails my daily to do list.,positive

2052,"I love the Dynamic Add Button, now that it's finally here in the Android version!",positive
2053,"Having migrated from Wunderlist (Thanks, MS) - really enjoying the similar experience I'm having with Todist. Definitely both worthy of the high praise it gets, and an alternative to Wunderlist for us migrating away. Pros: - The dark theme is really nice - ""Sections"" is a nice way to break up a list / project without having a sub list / project - Having colours assigned to different lists / projects, making it easier to categorise - Option to import from Wunderlist. Note I did not use this feature, but it's a pro because there's an option to i.e. I do not know how well it works or not Cons: - The resizing / reactiveness of the webapp isn't ideal ATM; on a 1920x1280 screen the web app occupies the middle third - Comments are a premium only feature, compared to being in the freebie section of Wunderlist - Ditto on labels being a premium only feature (hashtag support was available in Wunderlist) TL;DR: 4/5 Pretty awesome to-do app. I missing some of the features I had from a competitor but not deal-breakers",positive
2054,Only thing missing from this tool is an in-app calendar.,positive
2055,"It is pretty good, I use it everyday. However, I think adding recurring tasks is not very intuitive. You have to remember the ""every"" syntax. Some UI would help, especially for new users and non-native English speakers. Other than that, it's a pretty plain to-do list, does not include much gamification to keep you motivated to do what you have to do (other than setting a general goal number of tasks to do in a day or week). Reporting is a premium feature which comes in pretty thin too, you can only see a barchart of how many tasks you've completed each day in the past week or how many tasks you've completed every week in the past 4 weeks. For what it offers, the premium option feels a bit expensive.",positive
2056,I like the design and speed of the app But some features are behind a pay wall that are very helpful ( but they need to get money someway right ) The only thing that i dont like about the app is that its not possible to schedule repeting tasks,positive
2057,"Taking off a star because I'm not sure where else to give feedback about the update. I'm not a fan of having to click the drop-down box in the corner in order to select multiple tasks at once. Especially because the task selection mode expires each time I make a single change to the selected tasks, requiring me to then go into the drop-down menu again to and then re-select all of the tasks I just selected. I really liked before how I could just select multiple tasks and make multiple changes to them at once in a few clicks. I know this change was made to allow easy re-ordering of tasks, although I don't find this particularly helpful because I don't typically re-order my tasks. I would prefer that this is changed back or some kind of compromise is made so that it isn't so cumbersome to edit multiple tasks at once.",positive
2058,"Powerful and simple. The only thing missing is integration with Google calendar, which I used for years, and I do not see any option to migrate either. So, no backward search for the events, calendar sharing and other integrations. Well, task and project-wise, this is a powerhouse! Much more simple and well designed than Google Keep I've been using for years.",positive
2059,"Almost perfect. A feature I'd love is if using share could predict the project you're adding to based on the app you're sharing from. When I share from Spotify, YouTube or SoundCloud, it always goes to my ""Music"" project. I wish after doing that a dozen times todoist would know that I like to add these links to my ""Music"" protect and preselect it for me.",positive
2060,"I really enjoy this app! The design is very simple and well put together. The cute designs of people enjoying their day when I finish tasks is almost rewarding, and it's nice when the app tells me to enjoy my day off when I have no tasks. I like that I can color-code things and add subtasks, as well as create different priority levels for tasks. The only thing I wish it had was a monthly view. Then I would give it 5 stars.",positive
2061,"It is an extraordinarily designed app. However the subscription price is high. Please reduce the price so that more & more people can enroll Please add the option to have ""end time"" for each task, I mean the ""From"" and ""To"" time for each task. Also the unfinished tasks of ""Yesterday"" can automatically come to ""Today"" since tasks showing in yesterday's list does not make sense. Reducing one star for this. Once these changes are done, I will surely re-rate as 5 stars. Thanks..You guys Rock!!",positive
2062,A very good apps. It helps me a lot when it comes into managing my time. I love the features where I can set time by simply typing at 8pm for example. Good job developer,positive
2063,Its good but can work on notifocation panel,positive
2064,"I just would like to have also the possibility to set and see the amount of time estimated per each task or group of tasks, otherwise I am just in love for the app.",positive
2065,"I paid for premium on this and it is by far the best todo app I've used. The only thing keeping it from getting a 5 stars for me is that it needs an option to set what time your day ends or when the day starts. Because i usually end my day at 2am and by that time tasks become overdue and karma points are not credited for the previous day. Nonetheless, great app 👏🏼",positive
2066,Several features are limited if you don't have the premium version but it's still really useful. I use the widget on my homescreen very often.,positive
2067,What gives you as much flexibility as you need: + projects to grope tasks + lables + powerful filters alow you to create you personal views But: - it is possible to syncronize ONLY one google calendar!!! (which is funny as for Editor's choice app) - it is not possible to grope labels to set common color or search pattern - it is not possible to label a project so that all tasks created in a project get this label. I hole guys will fix the issue with calender otherwise all props do not worth it.,positive
2068,"It's really nice but I wish the notifications were better, like for some reason I don't get notified even though the task is due. It would also be good if we can add URLs beneath the name of the task, so that we can directly visit the link.",positive
2069,I would like to be able to move multiple tasks as subtasks instead of one at a time. That is the only criticism I have the rest is awesome!,positive
2070,Very helpful in getting me to do stuff but I wish reminders were free,positive
2071,"Very useful application, thanks! Could you please add tags grouping? Because I have created multiple different tags and now it is really mess!",positive
2072,Super app. One of features to add to basic version is type of calendar task distribution to visualise your week/month/year.,positive
2073,"So far, so good. I've only used the app for about a week. I'll write a more in-depth review soon.",positive
2074,"Some pieces are a bit less than intuitive, some scheduling features are better on the desktop app, and a buy forever option would be really cool. Otherwise no complaints.",positive
2075,"Very nice app with a lot of integrations which makes it very comfortable to use. Although I think some features are missing, e g. Grouping by project in a filtered view",positive
2076,Ticktick has much better widget customization,positive
2077,Just started using it....the interface is easy to learn and the amount of detail is just robust enough to be appropriate for what I do.,positive
2078,Solid free app. Being locked out of extra functionality with a paywall is a little irksome but nothing I can't got over. It does what I need it to.,positive
2079,"I would really love to see a pomodoro timer, habit tracker, and a kanban board. The subtasks management could be better as it is in TickTick. I really love how Todoist have 2-way Google calendar sync.",positive
2080,"It's a really great all, except that you can't make it buzz when you need to do something unless you pay.",positive
2081,"This app is awesome! Trust me, it will keep you on track!",positive
2082,The first to-do list app that makes me wanna do stuff instead of making longer and longer lists,positive
2083,It is goed better than I expected their windows app is bad but we all have a browser so that is not sometging bad.,positive
2084,It's very versatile; the project system makes it easy to group tasks together. The one problem is that it doesn't have a calendar view.,positive
2085,"Only began using it but seems intuitive to use. Love that I have various lists, link to projects, share lists, assign tasks and gave due dates",positive
2086,I had a bad time with time Management at work and at home. Now with my samsung and the routines I can get up this is the first app that wakes up in the morning. Giving me an opportunity to set up the day how I want and check them off as they're done.,positive
2087,"The feature of able to detect time, label, & projects on what i typed when editing tasks within inbox is now being removed (auto-detection still available on adding new tasks though) please consider to put it back",positive
2088,Easy to Navigate with simple task input and completion of task. Sense of accomplishment. I like it so far.,positive
2089,Some premium features should be free ! Otherwise good tool to manage one's projects.,positive
2090,Love using this but I just wish I could customize the widget more like the opacity and such to make it fit my phone's theme more (I have the premium version),positive
2091,"I think it's a bit silly that reminders & labels are premium features, but other than that: great app!",positive
2092,Gets the job done very well! Helps keep track of things necessary and streamlining is awesome!,positive
2093,Great app! Too bad a lot of helpful features are for premium only. I'd like to have a calendar layout of the week.,positive
2094,I've been using this app for a couple of months now and it's pretty good at helping to develop and track new habits.,positive
2095,Really helped me to level up my organizing and productivity! I wouldn't need all the premium features really tho.,positive
2096,I'm using the premium version a few days now. I'm not getting any notifications for my reminders. I checked the menu and everything is fine. Is there something you can do to help?,positive
2097,"Easy, useful app that connects all my platforms. Makes connecting in the business a breeze",positive
2098,"It's a cool app, but essential features are premium.",positive
2099,The full version allows you to do this. On the free version once you have completed a task you cannot see what it was.,positive
2100,Very good.,positive
2101,"Great app and it really helps me stay on top of things, though I do wish I could be able to put events in too for example :friends birthday from maybe 10 am to 2 pm and things like that",positive
2102,I like but there are some basic features that aren't free.,positive
2103,"It's a good app. It's pretty, minimalist and works really well. It just really bothers me that the ""undo"" (button that appears when you make a change) gets in the way of adding a new task and gets accidentally clicked, so I have to wait for it to go away. I would suggest for the developers to please take a look and see if you can adjust the placement of the buttons in this case. Thanks!",positive
2104,"Muito bom, só poderia liberar mais funcionalidades que só tem na versão premium",positive
2105,Not used the premium yet,positive
2106,"By far and away the best of all the dozens of task manager apps I've tried using! So intuitive. Can't wait for the ""upcoming"" feature that's on the way. But gotta thumbs-down the new widget. No way to open the app straight from the widget so I removed the widget from my home screen all together.",positive
2107,Good app!,positive
2108,"The new widget is an improvement, but the fact that I can no longer open the app from the widget is IMMENSELY frustrating. It means I have to waste home screen space in the app icon, and isn't that what a widget is supposed to avoid?",positive
2109,"Todoist is really useful if you have a variety of tasks that you need to carry out, but don't want to write it down on pen and paper.",positive
2110,It's best features are locked behind a paywall,positive
2111,Figured out how to schedule reminders but it could be easier,positive
2112,"Hi can I have an OPTION TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE NEW AND OLD DESIGNS OF THE WIDGET? The previous version was able to have larger boxes to fit long description tasks, while the new one just puts three dots and shortens the task descriptions to fit in one fixed width, which disables full reading of the task(bad). Also, subtasks cannot be seen WITHOUT CLICKING the main task, which kinda defeats the purpose(again) of having a todoist widget where i should be seeing the overview of everything. Thanks",positive
2113,"Please, make an option to use the old style widget. Unfortunartely letters became too small for 4x6 home screen grid.",positive
2114,Enjoy Todoist Premium but an update to the widget has made the fonts smaller. As this is more difficult to see I don't think it's an improvement.,positive
2115,By far this is the best to do list app I have used . But I have 2 issues with new widget. First :I can't press the icon and go to the app like I used to. The icon is gone now . And second: the font is too small .really hard to read my list .,positive
2116,"The app is excellent; simple, streamlined, functional to-do list. However, the newly redesigned widget gives me a heck of a lot _less_ control. How do I select and reschedule a group of tasks? How do I open the app from the widget (so I don't need both the widget and an icon)? If I wanted to do complex editing, I could easily open the app, and the widget could do things the app couldn't. Give it back!",positive
2117,Works well.,positive
2118,"I LOVE the new widget! It's finally useful! Please let us change the time when the day changes... For example, I go to bed at around 3AM. I consider any time before that to still be the technically previous day. That completely messes up tasks that repeat after completion...",positive
2119,It's a great app. It's sad it doesn't run on Samsung wearables,positive
2120,Hey guys the new update messed up the widget layout for me now everything is smaller and more difficult to read!,positive
2121,"I have barely began using this app (less than 15 minutes) and I am already in love! The Terms you have to agree to alone are just so assuring and satisfying. Kudos developers, kudos!",positive
2122,Easy to use. I will however like to have a time boxing feature for my daily activities.,positive
2123,Well,positive
2124,It Is a very handy app but the fact that premium is required to enable reminders kills the productivity boost I wanted to achieve,positive
2125,"It's a good assistant for daily life. But I don't like, that in there's a premium upgrade for money.",positive
2126,It is a fantastic apps. But if they can allow the push reminder in the free version it will make it perfect.,positive
2127,Straightforward solution for business and personal use in my cell and laptop. Sometimes I get a bit lost on how to get from granular details back to an overview of projects.,positive
2128,Good one,positive
2129,Ticktick has much better widget customization,positive
2130,Works well,positive
2131,"Good app, just wish you were able to back date a completed task so I can use it for tracking habits as well, but it's a to do list app and works well.",positive
2132,"Very nice working space, but the display of things can be a bit nicer.",positive
2133,"Despite the unresponsive widget, overall a pretty decent app.",positive
2134,We use it for running our home & project improvements. It is easy to use.. not as user attractive as some but ok.,positive
2135,"Great app! Easily share lists with others. Easy to add or check off items. One enhancement request would be to make another default view option the list of all projects, rather than having to choose one project to default view.",positive
2136,Super convenient,positive
2137,"Thanks , great app Please add Persian language",positive
2138,I love it,positive
2139,"Works well, except it keeps asking to change the timezone when I switch to firefox",positive
2140,شكرا,positive
2141,"It's an overall great app but the problem is that it notifies all of the notifications once be it at 8AM or 10PM. If there was an option where tasks are pinned on notification untill you check them from app, I'd give it a 5 star",positive
2142,Seems almost perfect. I'm missing a monthly view feature of the tasks/assignments/etc.,positive
2143,Great app. I love the subtasks option.,positive
2144,Solid. Perhaps overpriced.,positive
2145,Desktop version is better,positive
2146,Good app.,positive
2147,"Mostly a good app, helps me keep on top of things. Morning notifications are a bloody lifesaver. My only criticisms are that the free version is rather lacking in basic features, at least for people like me coming from other apps. Also the top bar and the system status bar when in the app are different colors, slightly, and that's always bugged me.",positive
2148,"I love the Dynamic Add Button, now that it's finally here in the Android version!",positive
2149,"Im using the free app & enjoying it alot! Super easy to capture ideas and reminders when they pop into your head, before you forget!",positive
2150,"I love this app. I tried many to do list apps but this is the one that meets my satisfaction, I guess? The basic features are good, just right. But I'll give it 4 stars since I'm still finding something I myself can't say and it's not here. Maybe it's in the premium version but I'm broke as hell and I can't afford to pay for it because I have other expenses. I do hope that some other features would someday be free, it'll be really helpful.",positive
2151,The best app for to-do lists. It does have a couple of minor issues: * The widget can become unusable once in a while (stuck forever on the loading screen). * It can also take a couple of seconds for an item to be removed after you check it off on the widget.,positive
2152,I run multiple businesses and so far this has helped me organize my days tremendously. A lot of initial decisions had to be made about where I want things and that took a while but now I'm really glad I took the time to do it because it's all coming together and actually relieving some stress. Hopefully I can come back and add the 5th star after I've had more time using it!,positive
2153,"Love the app, but there is a bug in the current version of the app where ""next week"" actually schedules things for two weeks out. Actually scheduling in general in the app seems a little wonky. These are new issues as of a few weeks ago. Otherwise it would be 5 stars.",positive
2154,"This is a great app, and I love it, bit I have two small issues with it. First, I don't like how insistent it is with notifying you to complete tasks. Second, I wish the interface had a better tutorial so that it would be easier to have the due dates and such easy to prepare when you enter the task in. Since fixing one would fix both, this is still a great app",positive
2155,Good place for storing tasks,positive
2156,Easy to work with,positive
2157,Its ok,positive
2158,I found todoist through Lavendaire of YouTube she is awesome. I am grateful that to-do list is really getting me back on track.,positive
2159,Im enjoying it so far,positive
2160,"You responded to but STILL DON'T understand my comment about repeating event scheduling. I KNOW that you can schedule repeating events, & I KNOW how to do that, but each repeating event is scheduled at intervals reliant on the original event date. What if I sometimes would like the event to repeat from the actual completion date? For example, I forget to renew my library books for a week. When I renew them finally l have 3 weeks before I need to review them again but your system says 2.",positive
2161,Good app easy to use. I like the fact that it emails my daily to do list.,positive
2162,Its good but can work on notifocation panel,positive
2163,"Great app for the most part. Functionality is amazing. Sync is great. But, I really hate that this app puts itself on top of whatever I'm doing every 5 minutes exactly. Been through all the settings and turned all syncing off but no. Incredibly obnoxious on my tablet. Haven't had the same issue on my Android phone",positive
2164,The free option has all the features I need. An alarm would be nice but since I don't have the premium I'll do without for now.,positive
2165,Love it.,positive
2166,"Learning, hopeful.",positive
2167,Works with home assistant,positive
2168,Easy to use and does it job to keep me on track.,positive
2169,Good app for management,positive
2170,Easy to use. Will continue further and decide if I will get the Premium.,positive
2171,"Playstore info says in-app purchases. I'm on premium longtime. App widgets for Gmail & calendar. Filters, labels, shorthand for dates, recurring etc., so flexible: *discipline* required to set your own process! Helpful examples and tutorials on their website. I do outlines for book, project, trips, recipes. attach files. I prefer web app on my Chromebook, then this app on mobile. Beware: App is addictive. Wanted: print as outline, tasks, dated comments",positive
2172,"A bit inconvenient interface when adding and asigning date to the task. Other than that pretty cool intuitive UI along with minimalistic style. My first choice of todo app, even free version is good enough to keep your plans out of your head but in this app.",positive
2173,Good,positive
2174,This will meet many people's needs. Best multi-platform apps. Best location reminders. Easy to use. I would like start dates and others have requested them for years but Todoist refuses to add them. Down a star for that. The offer a work-around but it's not convenient.,positive
2175,Awesome.,positive
2176,"Great app, good at keeping you accountable and productive. Would be nice to be able to re-order your to-dos though and set deadlines for when they have to be done",positive
2177,It's the perfect kind of list I've tried. Everything is great. It could be better if we had a calendar view as well.,positive
2178,"Good, no frill, direct for what you need in a to do list",positive
2179,Just started but I am interested.,positive
2180,"I've been using Todoist Premium for just over one year now. I think I've tried nearly every todo app out there. There has been some quirky behavior introduced over the last few months, especially around rescheduled occurrences of recurring tasks, and it's been a bit frustrating there. But overall, it's the best app for me and the team behind it seem like great people based on my interactions. Give it a shot!",positive
2181,تطبيق رائع جدا ومحفز للعمل. كل الشكر والتقدير والاحترام لهيئة تصميم البرنامج,positive
2182,Very helpful in getting me to do stuff but I wish reminders were free,positive
2183,"Great app to keep tight training schedules and regimes. Premium isnt necessary, only downfall would be reminders notifications more than once",positive
2184,Paid experience is better than free. But it will do since there are no ads. UI and design can be made note clutter free.,positive
2185,"So far, so good. I've only used the app for about a week. I'll write a more in-depth review soon.",positive
2186,Cool. Keeping track of my stuffs is very good.,positive
2187,Just started but it seems easy to pick up,positive
2188,Great app only annoying that the mobile and desktop app don't always sync up,positive
2189,Simple to use clean interface,positive
2190,"I still feel like it's more complicated than necessary, but it is good for special projects",positive
2191,"Very useful app, gives reminders, easy to set up.",positive
2192,Only thing missing from this tool is an in-app calendar.,positive
2193,Easy to use,positive
2194,This app has helped me be productive with the amount of features it has. The only negative I would say is that I would have liked to see the reminders feature included for free,positive
2195,So far so good,positive
2196,"This app is awesome! Trust me, it will keep you on track!",positive
2197,Can I have your email please,positive
2198,All of the free features are really good and I am way more organized,positive
2199,"Крутое приложение! Вероятно, перейду на премиум подписку. Тем не менее есть один нюанс, что мне не понравился и пока не смог найти решение. Когда в проекте создаёшь задачу и для нее указываешь под задачи, то они отображаются с отступом. Если все эти под задачи назначить на выполнение на определенную дату, то во вкладке Today, все задачи будут отображаться одним сплошным списком, без какого либо визуального разделения на задачи и под задачи.",positive
2200,"Updating for 2020-still the most important app I use. It's been life-changing. ---- Todoist is the most important app I use. It's a tremendous way to keep track of professional and personal projects and tasks, make lists (weekly menu, shopping lists), collaborate at work, and keep track of my kids' responsibilities. Doist is an ethical, bootstrapped company with a customer-centric vision and a regular release schedule. If I could marry Todoist, you know I would.",positive
2201,"Awesome! Was using Wunderlist, but they are going away. I tried a few others. They are all so similar now. But this one seems like it will be here for the long haul judging by the number of downloads. Also, it is as simple as Wunderlist. I did have to pay $29 and Waunderlist was free for the most important functions, so that was different. But after using the app for a week I'm sold. Not a better app out there for my purposes. KISS- keep it simple stupid. And this app does that.",positive
2202,"Todoist has always been one of the most useful apps for me. I have migrated to offline world recently and have decided to plan my works in my journal (instead of Todoist and GCal). However, still I needed a listing app. After a bunch of search between the apps, Todoist is still the best app I can use for making lists 😇 (by the way, I should ignore some of its features like daily goals and replace the term of ""project"" with ""list"" in my mind! But it is a perfect choice for me 😊)",positive
2203,"So far the app has functioned excellently. I have not run into any issues. It's very simple and straight forward. However, I do recommend you read the user start guide as you'll find out about not so intuitive functions which make everything not only more seamless but even simpler than before. I would seriously recommend to anyone looking for a Todo app, I've been using the free version and no complaints and no ads. Definitely give it a try and you won't regret it.",positive
2204,"it has all the practical features that I need in order to just keep my tasks and projects organized. it is useful and user-friendly. I might go for the premium features if I see the need for them. But even without premium, it is still a very helpful application.",positive
2205,"Moved here from Wunderlist, after trying other apps. This is so clean and easy to use and does everything I needed and more. My fiance and I can now both keep track of the grocery list! (So glad it has the ability to share with others)",positive
2206,"This app is perfect for my personal task management. You can make it as simple or complex as you want. I like how easy it is to quick add tasks, schedule, and how I can integrate with Gcal. Every idea I have to do anything goes in here. I need reminders for everything; I even use Todoist to remind me to change the sheets :)",positive
2207,"This app is really helpful. Earlier,I thought that to do list apps were useless and were a total waste of time. But this app is a real time saver. The reason is that earlier I had to think what I have to do and need to do in my mind, but now I can write in my to do list and get stress free",positive
2208,"Quite simply, the best. Cannot get over how user-friendly Todoist is--the devs clearly designed with *intention*. Pre-made templates are a godsend, text markup/emoji integration made me smile, and powerful organizational features made me stay. Kudos 🙌",positive
2209,"The GREATEST personal organization app I have used. Cool and simple user experience, works on all major platforms so you can access your lists from virtually anywhere. If you are looking for a way to get organized and productive, this what you are looking for.",positive
2210,"After I found out Wunderlist was going away I look for an app that could do all the things that could do as it was pretty much perfect for me todoist is pretty much as good, not perfect but for free I can't complain!",positive
2211,"Very efficient app, a real time-saver ! And since the last update, a new widget extremely well-made and customizable : you don't even need to actually open the app !",positive
2212,"Wow, this is so slick. Has to be the most polished app I have ever used. Not really surprised as the web, Windows and iOS are all superb as well. This is so worth the $4 a month.",positive
2213,"Love it. Only tweak I'd love to see is when you have something to reschedule and you open the Smart Rescheduler feature, when you click on the item you can customize the suggested date.",positive
2214,"Really great. It is clear & effective. I can create my own projects and follow them, It shows me tasks from yesterday that I forgot to do and so forth.",positive
2215,"This is a great app. I installed it two months ago, and I use it everyday. It keeps me awake to all my appointments, and helps me to organize everything. I recommend it to everyone.",positive
2216,"Really good app w nice interface and easy to learn layout. Lets u divide tasks by ""projects"" which i find really useful! Also gives subtasks, which also helps a lot. Would recommend :)",positive
2217,"I have been enjoying this app for a good while, over a year now. The recent update moved this app from ok, useful with some mild frustration, to amazing. Super pleased with this fix.",positive
2218,"Absolutely the best to do app out there. Great UI, great features. Use it for general stuff, shared shopping lists and household tasks, projects... everything. Well worth it for the paid version too. The only features I'd like to see are more than once a day scheduling (eg. morning, noon and night; can workaround with multiple tasks) and repeatable projects (think recipes; can workaround with templates but difficult).",positive
2219,free version has a lot of functionality but i do plan on paying after a few weeks of using it... just to see if i will use it consistently,positive
2220,Excellent app with useful features to get stuff done! Thankfully not bloated with ads or useless features. Highly recommend!,positive
2221,Seems great so far. If you add an option to make the widget clear or transparent I'll give you money for premium. *edit- they literally added this for me in less than a week,positive
2222,"Great app, easy to use, no bumps or lumps so far, no annoying 24/7 interruptions like a lot of apps produce !!!",positive
2223,"Very good, has power user features as well like defining properties through text and stuff. Haven't tried the collaboration part yet!",positive
2224,Excellent update. Thanks Todoist team. I would suggest customizing the font size on the widget as it seems small.,positive
2225,"This is a great app, it has made my life so much easier. I have tried other apps but this one has to be the best one so far. If you are thinking about getting it you should.",positive
2226,"Best ""to do"" app I try, very intuitive interface. My day now is completely organized. Karma feature is very interesting and motivating. Thank you for this amazing app.",positive
2227,"Great to-do app that does everything you want, also syncs perfectly with planner for Elementary OS.",positive
2228,I've never been able to stick to using a To Do list until now. Great interface and features.,positive
2229,"Great, works with my Google home so I can just blurt out stuff that pops into my head without interrupting what I'm doing. I would like a bit more control over the details and settings in the app itself but that's just me",positive
2230,"Great To-Do list app that handles reminders well, it is perfect for my needs.",positive
2231,"Two things could be improved. 1. There should be a option if I want to view the tasks organized into sub-projects in a project view. (Concerning the last update) 2. The sub-tasks could be better organized. Maybe nested inside the options, just like in Microsoft's task app.",positive
2232,Has literally changed my life. I use it for everyday tasks and chores. My husband and I literally no longer argue about what needs to be done around the house. I also use it as a grocery list as well so my husband and I can add things to it and when we go to the grocery store we just swipe of that we got it. Absolutely life changing.,positive
2233,Best productivity app. Very intuitive to use and a must have for power users,positive
2234,Solid to-do-list app with very nice features such as karma points and 7-days ahead. The best app in my opinion,positive
2235,"Great app! Todoist will send reminders that I have 0 due for the day. This makes me think twice if I really have nothing to complete for the day which that is not the case! So it makes me add task and by the end of the day, I got some things done!",positive
2236,"I'm only two weeks in and purchased premium and killing it (even more than usual) at work. I love this program! I mostly use it on my desktop but it's great for when I think of things after hours, am on the road with my boss or walking out he office door and someone throws something my way I need to remember.",positive
2237,I made a resolution to set better habits to steward my time and researched some options. I found this through Tim Challies' recommendation from the book Do More Better & productivity worksheet. He also provided some helpful tips to setting up different tasks under projects and categorizing the roles/responsibilities you have in your life (which is ever changing). I really like that I can set certain tasks to repeat daily or weekly and see the next 7 days ahead to plan out my day/week.,positive
2238,It's very helpful in keeping track of tasks and managing time.,positive
2239,"Life changer. Love being able to make nested subtasks and being able to assign dates to them! Web app, and windows app work incredible well and feel native. Great Google Assistant integration, but wish it was default for reminders which is probably something Google needs to do to support it. Only complaint is wish task descriptions were free but pricing plans are quite reasonable.",positive
2240,"Great all-around app. Free features are enough for most users, though thete are some nice premium perks for upgrading. Love being able to create items using natural voice. This app is tough to beat. I keep trying other apps and always return here.",positive
2241,"Was initially sad that Wunderlist got shut down, but so happy to have discovered Todoist instead. I like it even better -- it is smart but also simple and not overwhelming. Wonderfully designed.",positive
2242,"Great design, autocomplete the date if you add words such as ""do something Wednesday"" and many other autocompletion features It's the best out there for sure, and I've tried them all",positive
2243,"Great app, I love how well thought UX it has. Thanks to the free month to try it I could really try if the app is good for me and now I am happy premium customer because it is by far the best app for todos. I am using it for my a bit enhanced GTD and my productivity has actually skyrocketed ever since I use Todoist 😊",positive
2244,Super app... Can keep tracks of different types of lists really well... Just one thing I wish they had the slide and add more things in a section even in the today tomorrow next week lists It would make the process faster Than choosing the date in the calender again n again.,positive
2245,Good way to keep in touch with actions - works well with planners.,positive
2246,The experience is being great! The app is really useful and beyond expectations,positive
2247,Love this app! It has really helped improve my productivity!,positive
2248,"Great app, using it all the time... Would be great to have a toggle for switching on and off the view of the completed tasks in ""today"" mode. This motivates even more, if you see how many things you accomplished today...",positive
2249,I have enjoyed using the app. I like that you can plan to do something and it's tossed into the void or tossed into a bucket for planning later I wish I could hide buttons related to premium features but once you get used to what is what you can avoid them,positive
2250,Literally everything that i ever need in a todolist app... the minimalistic design and AMAZING user interface is soo user-friendly and helpful to stay organised and plan my days accordingly. Honestly this has been nothing short of a life changer for me.,positive
2251,This app is sooooo helpful for me as a student to help me stay focused and productive. It gives little reminders to get you back on track and it's a must for any student or busy person,positive
2252,"Works perfectly. Incredibly fair subscription system that's worth the money, but not necessary for a good user experience.",positive
2253,Great free experience! I can organize my to-do lists into projects with subtasks. It's almost like a sprint board for my life.,positive
2254,"Really easy to use task manager, ability to schedule posts and get alerts when you're over due, great layout in projects or per week, ability to add links, emails, and subtasks - made my work life a lot easier!",positive
2255,"Turned around my productivity life, slowly but surely. It's all in how you use it: I recommend starting slow with a couple tasks a day that you already do and then slowly adding things you find you need to do. Clean interface and helpful karma system.",positive
2256,"Cool and descent. Just wish to show completed things automatically. Each time i need to look at them Also while showing completed things, display it as recent first 1. To do 2. Completed recent 3. Past complete .. .. Like wise",positive

2259,"Initially it didn't let me view the shopping list synced from Alexa on my Android Smart Watch. However, as the developer says, if it is added to the Favorites, Alexa shopping list gets synced.",positive
2260,Great app! I use it to keep track of work projects and my tasks for courses I take for my masters. The free version is perfect enough for what I use it for.,positive

2262,"Being able to set a task's date, time, or project name by just typing is game-changing.",positive
2263,"Love it especially the natural language e.g write every tuesday, friday do ... Then it will automatically repeat ... Every tuesday, friday.",positive
2264,Love it. I'm actually getting things done! It takes a little bit of learning to work out how to make recurring tasks etc but once you do it's all there. (Free version),positive

2269,It does a beautiful job at helping you use their app through their website and other tutorials. It makes you soooo much more likely to stick to using it than other apps.,positive
2270,Best App I've tried (for this purpose) and I stopped trying others until further notice. I'm considering paying for the fancy things since the app is so smooth and it's cheap enough.,positive
2271,"If you like checking boxes off, this is a great app. You can create lists, sublists, and even nest tasks inside of a list. It's a great organizational list app.",positive
2272,"Excellent app, continuous improvements make app be in the top 1% of Productivity category",positive

2281,"Perfect task tracking app I absolutely love automatically set repeated tasks. For example, you write ""pay rent every 25th"" and the task sets repeat every 25th day of month",positive

2289,"absolutely amazing app, the best for to do lists.",positive

2295,Great app for managing and completing tasks in a form of projects.,positive
2296,Satisfied. But to me too little functions for free version. I'm not able to judge whether I'm ready to pay for full version,positive

2304,Very Great app to keep everything on list and do it with out fail,positive

2306,So useful!,positive
2307,It's cutting edge of all to-do-list apps! 💪,positive
2308,Fits my needs almost exactly!,positive
2309,"Exceptional, Tip Top Services, mateys...",positive

2323,"Intuitive, flexible, and free from nagging ads",positive
2324,Lovely app with good UI,positive
2325,"Love the app, I've signed up to premium a year ago and I'm continuing my subscription. I'm using the getting things done (GTD) methodology with this app. A feature idea: allow users to choose when ""today"" ends or when ""tomorrow"" starts. E.g. my day doesn't really finish at midnight every day, I consider my day finished when I go to sleep, which sometimes can be at 3-4 am. So I would choose 6 am to be my ""tomorrow"" so those tasks don't mess up my to do list on nights when I work late.",positive
2326,Intuitive and fun,positive
2327,Nice app,positive
2328,Great app all in all,positive

2351,👍,positive
2352,"It is so nice and useful app, thanks a lot developers",positive

2365,Great,positive
2366,"Very good app, but It would be nice if you add lasting tasks, for an example a task that starts at 14:00 and finishes at 15:00 I hope you understood me :P",positive
2367,Very easy to use!,positive
2368,"This app (and Google add-on) is amazing, even the free version. However, the new widget is worse than the old one. One major reason I say that is because the old version allowed overdue tasks to be rescheduled with a single touch. In this new one, so far, you have to go back into the app.",positive
2369,"Amazing, this is the app I've needed! Haven't even dived into all the features yet. 🙌🏻",positive
2370,Excellent service!,positive

2385,Awesome app!!!,positive
2386,Makes me more productive,positive
2387,Outstanding To-Do App.,positive
2388,"So far the app has functioned excellently. I have not run into any issues. It's very simple and straight forward. However, I do recommend you read the user start guide as you'll find out about not so intuitive functions which make everything not only more seamless but even simpler than before. I would seriously recommend to anyone looking for a Todo app, I've been using the free version and no complaints and no ads. Definitely give it a try and you won't regret it.",positive
2389,"Best ""to do"" app I try, very intuitive interface. My day now is completely organized. Karma feature is very interesting and motivating. Thank you for this amazing app.",positive
2390,"Very good, has power user features as well like defining properties through text and stuff. Haven't tried the collaboration part yet!",positive
2391,"Great to-do app that does everything you want, also syncs perfectly with planner for Elementary OS.",positive
2392,"absolutely amazing app, the best for to do lists.",positive
2393,Ace I love it,positive
2394,Solid to-do-list app with very nice features such as karma points and 7-days ahead. The best app in my opinion,positive
2395,Love it,positive
2396,"Quite simply, the best. Cannot get over how user-friendly Todoist is--the devs clearly designed with *intention*. Pre-made templates are a godsend, text markup/emoji integration made me smile, and powerful organizational features made me stay. Kudos 🙌",positive
2397,I love this app,positive
2398,"Awesome! Was using Wunderlist, but they are going away. I tried a few others. They are all so similar now. But this one seems like it will be here for the long haul judging by the number of downloads. Also, it is as simple as Wunderlist. I did have to pay $29 and Waunderlist was free for the most important functions, so that was different. But after using the app for a week I'm sold. Not a better app out there for my purposes. KISS- keep it simple stupid. And this app does that.",positive
2399,"This app is perfect for my personal task management. You can make it as simple or complex as you want. I like how easy it is to quick add tasks, schedule, and how I can integrate with Gcal. Every idea I have to do anything goes in here. I need reminders for everything; I even use Todoist to remind me to change the sheets :)",positive
2400,The free version is crippled. 3 lists max. Seriously? Just use DTG GTD. To do app with free unlimited nested to-do lists with tags and reminders.,negative
2401,"Even after several updates, the problem persists: Despite adding and sceduling tasks, the calender inside the app isnt showing any tasks at all. No tasks visible at all in the in-app calendar view. In the calendar widget however, i can see tasks arranged datewise. Honestly, yours is a really nice app with features, but what's the point to having them if they don't work in the first place.",negative
2402,"for years I use ticktick, I love it so much, I rated it 5 in Play store.. But the recent several changes to the app are make the app getting worse and keep getting worse than before. I incredibly sad and disappointed. for years I rely on ticktick as my todolist app, and now I have to find other alternative that can be as good as ticktick that I know before. that's not an easy thing to do",negative

2404,"while using the habbit feature, you can add multiple reminders for drinking water, but if you check done in any one of those reminders then it wont remind for the rest of the day. ruins the logic. Uninstalled Installed a year later and still the issue exists, the habit feature was a unique point which brought me to the app but I guess I'll have to use another one.",negative
2405,I am unable to upgrade my account to premium. I've tried multiple times but to no avail. :/,negative
2406,"Cannot share entire calendar and/or task database with other users. Only single daily task shares or individual list collaborations. Edit: very solid low 1 star, 0 if I could, since the developer couldn't even be bothered to read the entire of two sentences of review, acknowledging what features they did have.",negative
2407,"Another app that fails to draw events correctly on day view If I have an event from 3:00 to 3:15 and another from 3:15 to 3:30 there should be drawn with a space between them no matter how much I am zoomed in, they are not overlapping events so don't treat them like they are",negative
2408,"You need to pay. It's uselles without paying. Seriously, just 9 list for free?. If you need more list just add them in wunderlist and then import them to this app. Or better, stick with todo from Microsoft, it's free.",negative
2409,"Downloaded ticktick. Thought it seemed cool, so signed in with google account and tried to sign up for monthly subscription. Kept getting error messages and it wouldn't let me start the process or even add a card. Waste of time.",negative
2410,VERY GOOD APP BUT IN WIDGET THERE IS A NO OPTION IN LIST WISE SELECT TODAY TOMORROW OR ALL PLEASE UPDATE FOR THIS OPTION THEN IT WILL BE FAR BETTER PLEASE UPDATE EXAMPLE IF THERE'S A CALL LIST IN WIDGET IT SHOWS IN CALL WIDGET LIST ALL CALL TODAY TOMORROW OTHER ALL DAY BUT IT SHOULD OPTION TO SELECT TODAY TOMORROW ETC.,negative

Tf?! Since when are hyphens in address so uncommon that they're not worth supporting. Terrible, imo, UX (both in app and for customer service).",negative
2421,"I never give reviews. I believe in if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it.

There is NO subscription for me to cancel...I am really over it with this!!!",negative
2422,"I agree with other reviewers here: the new notification redesign from v5.3.0 on Android 10 is a bad idea and results in a confusing and unhelpful user experience. The new notifications violate Google's Material Design standards, which Google have provided to app developers for a good reason: to provide a consistent user experience across all apps. The new notifications look strange and behave badly compared to standard Android notifications. Please kindly revert back to the official Android notification standards that you used prior to v5.3.0! I've also sent you an email providing more details about this.",negative

2424,Be aware: if you purchase the paid version and then try to cancel within the 14 days trial. You won't be able to. They only reply once a day if you contact them and every time you contact them you have to explain that you want to cancel the service making the days passed by and after a while they just stop replying back. Using these shady tactics to make the 14 days goes by so you can't cancel after that. This company is a joke!,negative

Now it is impossible to change or mute the sound, no matter what setting I change inside or outside the app, and whether or not I give the app the permissions it wanted. 4 stars when this is fixed.",negative

2442,Update 2/19/2020: I cant recommend this app to anyone. The smart date parsing only works reliably if you enter it using military time. Also the fact that you have to enable alarm mode to have reminders fire on time is ridiculous. I have many apps that push notifications on time and don't require that. So the developers don't know how to do reminders correctly. Horrible app.,negative
2443,I have used this app for years but there is now a major issue. If you drag a task to tomorrow or place it under a task with a later date the task date no longer changes date. Is there any way to revert to an earlier revision? Hi I have sent screenshots but the issue is the same.,negative

2450,I don't understand why the App has all the languages except the Arabic language?,negative
2451,"Hides too much behind the subscription. The day views are an example of this. You'll need to pay each month for the ability to see your data displayed in month, week, 3 day, etc. The app feels broken with all of buttons you can press that nag you to pay monthly for features that should only be paid for once. The features that aren't locked behind the subscription can be found in other to do apps. I tried this app and ended up choosing a different one.",negative
2452,"An awesome app. Best in field. But expensive at $30+ subscription for EVERY single year that you want to use the premium feature and yet ZERO way to contact developers for support other than a fairly useless ""Help guide"" that has every question under the sun except the one that you need answered. I would expect much more from an app that cost $30+ each and every year!! Very poor, and a pity because its fundamentally a great app.",negative

2455,I created a task for picking up groceries and set it to a specific day.

2457,Does not sync with Google Task List unless you pay 2.99/month or their annual rate. Quite disappointed since their beautiful platform does not meet minimum sync options of Google task lists.

2613,"Has been one of the best reminder app available for a long time. This most recent update messed up notifications on Android 10. They don't follow the system dark mode at all, instead you have to manually change it in the app or deal with mismatched colors. It looks ridiculous seeing a white notification background amidst other black backgrounds in dark mode. It also looks like the black is not a true black like other apps. If this isn't fixed soon, I'll be looking for a new reminder app.",negative
2614,"I really like this app, it's one of the best reminder apps there is. However the new custom notifications are horrible! It sticks out like a sore thumb. You have to manually set between white or black background, which means that they don't automatically switch with Android 10 dark mode. They're also not black, but grey which makes them look ugly next to other notifications. Title and time also don't line up with other notifications. Plus it says ""a min. ago"", which is only accurate if I look at my phone immediately. And it turns on the screen when the notification comes in, even if it's in my pocket. This is a great app, but the recent update is one of those 'if it ain't broken don't fix it' moments. I really hope you consider going back to standard Android notifications, or at least provide an option between custom or standard. I'll gladly update my review to 5 stars if that happens.",negative

2753,"I really like this app, it's one of the best reminder apps there is. However the new custom notifications are horrible! It sticks out like a sore thumb. You have to manually set between white or black background, which means that they don't automatically switch with Android 10 dark mode. They're also not black, but grey which makes them look ugly next to other notifications. Title and time also don't line up with other notifications. Plus it says ""a min. ago"", which is only accurate if I look at my phone immediately. And it turns on the screen when the notification comes in, even if it's in my pocket. This is a great app, but the recent update is one of those 'if it ain't broken don't fix it' moments. I really hope you consider going back to standard Android notifications, or at least provide an option between custom or standard. I'll gladly update my review to 5 stars if that happens.",negative

I'm really surprised that the programmers are not able to add this feature also at the windows app. It's annoying so anoying that you have to edid every task in Android again to add a location reminder..... But it seems to be to difficult for the programmers...??? So when this is to difficult what can we expect? Will the maintanance of the Windows app stay on a reliable basis???

I want an app to create an hourly task today, that doesn't require me to enter in a reminder for every hour in the day.

Really I just want a flexible natural language reminder app.",neutral
2860,I loved TT and paid for Premium but sooner or later their reminder will let you down :( You can't count on it unfortunately. And it's not because of Android but due to a flaw in the app. If a reminder pops up and you accidentally tap somewhere else in the screen or if you're busy now then the reminder disappears and never reminds you again until you manually find this task again in the list and set a new date for the reminder.,neutral

It has some very good and strong features, specially related to reminders, recurring reminders, some ability to recognise natural language dates etc. However it needs to improve MUCH more in search abilites. Except for tags and list names search terms do not show up as you type. Search for tasks with multiple word combinations in the task title does not work. Robust solid search is still sorely lacking",neutral
2868,"I wanted to like it... I've always drooled at the idea of having a to do list app integrate with a calender. But alas, this version is clunky. You can't delete a single date of a recurring calender event, meaning you can't flexibly plan your day while beginning with a rough outline. I switched over to to-doist and Google calender instead.",neutral
2869,This is one of the better todo list apps and integrates with events nicely.  It is severely let down by poor synchronisation with Google tasks (too slow or forget it) which limits its usefulness where syncing with other applications is a concern.  Others sync much more effectively.,neutral

My main issue here with the app, is premium pricing. Why exactly do I have to pay a monthly fee for features that can be used offline?

You know something like a focus timer, I guess it would not be bad, actually I think this might seem like copying a feature from other apps in your field but isn't it better if there's more functionality.",positive
3219,Wunderlist being killed by Microsoft.... Seems like most people are coming to this app instead of moving to the recommended Microsoft To Do. Giving this a try.,positive
3220,"Almost there..! This app is the almost perfect solution for my job. I suggest for subtasks to have their own text formatting and check lists. Additionally, the summary page is cluttered: If I could turn off task descriptions within the summary, but still keep subtasks, I could better understand my weekly summaries. Lastly, I want to mark (sub)tasks as NOT COMPLETE if I know I didn't complete a task but I don't want it showing up as overdue. Summary formatting for this would remain the same.",positive
3221,"Not bad It's a basic to-do list which establishes days when a project is to be completed and a list of tasks that were uncompleted. Uncomplicated and useful. I would like to see the option that shows a job partially completed... some projects need to be held over and a more customisable repeat process ... every fortnight, or third Friday of the week.",positive
3222,"I like the simple interface and it helps me set reminders for tasks, schedule them and analyse them.",positive
3223,"Nearly Perfect! This app has replaced at least three other apps I used to have on my phone. It's a great utility that forms part of my everyday life. Accompanied by an affordable pricing model and not the ""money hungry"" ideology that so many mobile app devs have these days, it's nearly perfect. I would love to be able to link a habit to a task and see a view of habit progress. Like chaining in other habit apps. Keep up the great work!",positive
3224,"Pros: this app is very similar to the functionality of Wunderlist and adds features I wanted. Free version is fully functional except for the limitation of 9 lists Cons: Some of the widget buttons are small and I am not a fan of subscription services for premium features (I would pay a one-time fee, even for each upgrade, but i absolutely won't subscribe)",positive
3225,"Huge amount of functionality in free version. stopped short of 5* because duplicate functionality v limited. When i duplicate tasks I cannot duplicate to any other location than current one and cannot change name, and the new name is set as old name plus ""copied"". Would be very helpful to have duplication functionality that I can copy tasks (or indeed a whole list) and on copying them can have the duplicates placed where I wish and make choice about naming convention",positive
3226,"Love the app, but I notice it skips a reminder from time to time.",positive
3227,"Very good, could have a little more utilities for the free version",positive
3228,"amazing functionality; however, I wish there was a guide for some of the more advanced features.",positive
3229,"TickTick looks like a powerful and flexible productivity app but I find the help and support information across platforms somewhat overwhelming and confusing. I think that (for the easily confused) it would benefit from a good tidy-up, beginning with a clear conceptual overview of the design philosophy and architecture of the product and the methodology of its use, including flow diagrams and examples, before any specific platform advice.",positive
3230,"Hi, I previously posted a review to this app and I was furious. I gave it a single star because many choices are premium. But when I started to use the app, I learnt that this is app is really good for productivity. And I am glad that I am using it. I can't say it's perfect without you paying for the premium version but it's pretty good app.!",positive
3231,"Great addition to having a calendar. I can set text reminders for To Dos from here so I don't have to clutter my family's digital calendar with details for my days. Took a while to get how the app and folders work, but I have a good system set up now.",positive
3232,"Please, solve the problem with fast typing! After I type in the date, letters and numbers REMAIN",positive
3233,Can't fully scroll to the bottom of the options list of a task. Can't see the delete option fully.,positive
3234,Quite adequate for reminders ; Simple and easy to use.,positive
3235,"Overall good app. Interface is easy to use, effective and powerful. Would be good if it had better integration with calendars and other services. While many features are free, premium is a continuous subscription and quickly adds up to be very expensive.",positive
3236,"I really like it so far. I did have one problem, where i checked off a task i had completed (that was a weekly task) and then the following week it did not show up on my list because it had deactivated somehow. I'm sure they will fix it soon.",positive
3237,Great app for task reminders. Reminders notifications works well. Easy to use.,positive
3238,Liked wunderlist better. Can't add more than one share. I wanted family grocery list.,positive
3239,"Overall very good, but cant make a task with splitscreen.",positive
3240,Great app. Still waiting for RTL support and sub folders. Please!!,positive
3241,"This app does exactly what you need it to. Not perfect, but great at its job.",positive
3242,"Finally an organised app for notes and daily planning with a modern UI. It works great. Only downside is that payments are monthly. I'd rather pay it immediately. Though, in my opinion the app offers sufficient features in the free version.",positive
3243,Wow they listened. They added links between task which was my idea. Good. If only they could be consistent across platforms. Improve rating to 4 stars just cuz the ticktick team is really trying to be better Aldous allow us to see the changes you make in the app.,positive
3244,Good but needs to increase responsiveness to fingerprint ( takes time to unlock ),positive
3245,Useful but slow to synchronize across devices. Could evolve to become even more uh ser friendly,positive
3246,"Nearly the perfect 5 star app, but I have just one gripe, which is that unlike most reminders apps, the due / overdue takes don't change colour to make it clear at a glance which of your reminders are for now, and which ones are upcoming.",positive
3247,"Excellent overall, very flexible with many useful features. Only suggestion I'd make for improvement is a feature that as the user if they really intend to complete a task that has been snoozed multiple times.",positive
3248,"My go-to todo list app. I'd love for the habits feature to be improved, though.",positive
3249,"Been using for about a year. Getting more and more useful every day. Works well across Android, iPad, and Windows 10.",positive
3250,Great app. Ideal for planning ur day. Nice premium subscription,positive
3251,"Wish it supported sharing, but otherwise a fantastic, simple to do list app",positive
3252,"Good, simple app that works well. It keeps my to-do list synced between my Android phone and web browser on my computer.",positive
3253,Not very intuitive sometimes but a useful app I use daily.,positive
3254,After update time picker control is bad. It's very difficult to pick a time and it takes much more time to pick it. Please revert it as it was before. + one 🌟 for reverted time picker,positive
3255,"Very good, have been using it daily for work. However, I really dislike that I cannot change the date for one of many recurring events. It changes the whole lot.",positive
3256,One of the best ToDo apps. I'm not using the FULL version just basic as single user. For me the only failing is I want more options on recurring dates e.g. 14th of each month except Jan & Feb.,positive
3257,I first installed this app on an older tablet where the performance was an issue. Since I have installed it on my smartphone it has performed above average.,positive
3258,"I love this app and use it constantly, but there doesn't seem to be a way to add subtasks in the app. I don't have access to the desktop version. Other than that, great app.",positive
3259,"Great App, reliable and useful, however would be great if the kanban view was also available on mobile :) other than that I'm very satisfied with the app 👍",positive
3260,"Very user-friendly, easy-to-use and well designed app to keep track of all your tasks/lists. Too bad the premium version is so expensive",positive
3261,"Pretty good for me, but in the version I have I can't edit a task.",positive
3262,Easy to use. A direct link with other apps(Google calendar/ outlook calendar) would be a great add ON.,positive
3263,Good app..but everytime for particular thing should go inside every remainder and check.. Other than that. Beneficial app. Very good.. will recommend this.,positive
3264,Pretty good and getting better with feedback. My favourite part is the integrated calendar rather than relying on third party calendar.,positive
3265,"Great, premium allows for more alarms and reminders . But I don't have premium so that sucks.",positive
3266,"I wish this would sync with my Google task, so that i can use it on my computer and ipad.",positive
3267,"Best To do app for me, just one issue : The pricing is too high for an app of this nature, I want to pay once and forget.",positive
3268,The app is really good but there shouldn't be a premium version of this app it should be free.,positive
3269,Urgent-Where is your backup function to externally export task. U would have received a 5 star from me if u had this function. This app has almost everything except most important thing,positive
3270,"Nice app, use it almost everyday. I wish you had the option to rollover the unfinished tasks for the next day",positive
3271,Everything is pretty much amazing but it should have a Note tab(without checkboxes) where we can put important note not task.,positive
3272,It's great in reminding to take my meds. Want an option to mark tasks as incomplete instead of canceling from list.,positive
3273,"Like the app but instead of monthly payment, it should have been a one time app purchase",positive
3274,MKBHD suggested this app. The free version is very good. Gets my work done.,positive
3275,Was a big fan but changed the clock to spinner. Scrolling is a pain. Why did you guys change it? Bring back the normal clock asap.,positive
3276,Very good. How about a tutorial about making best use of TickTick?,positive
3277,"Great app for my Todos and calendar, would give 5 starts if they fix the ""show in calendar only"" bug",positive
3278,Thank you for bringing back the clock time picker! This app is essential for my daily todos.,positive
3279,Great App! Reminders are working and easy to use!,positive
3280,Great app but is subscription based app.,positive
3281,Incredible app with serious problems of synchronization.,positive
3282,Good alternative to Todoist with some extra features that were a must for me ex. Dedicated calendar.,positive
3283,It would be more useful if user can provide interdependence and correlation between various actions and lists,positive
3284,Edit... The 2-tap reminder set is back. Upgraded back to 4-stars.,positive
3285,"Beautiful design but, I'd prefer a one time option for the PRO version",positive
3286,Excellent job. I don't give you 5 🌟 because I don't wanna see the panel on status bar when I already completed my tasks. It's very annoying to me. If you will resolve this problem then I will give you 5 🌟. insha Allah 💚☮️,positive
3287,"Great app, I like recording tasks verbally.",positive
3288,Widget remains blank (tasks don't appear) on my OnePlus 7Pro phone. Any suggestions?,positive
3289,Great app. I suggest having more reminder options,positive
3290,"Have been quite satisfied with Premium for a year. Would have been so good with a monthly/weekly calendar view for my TickTick tasks, like the web app has. No calendar icon, although the doc vaguely states that there is. Guess it has been removed. Well, it still has a tiny edge to the competition.",positive
3291,"I love this app. The only change I wish they would make is that certain words and all numbers become dates that the app tries to make into a deadline. Sometimes I just want to write the word ""tomorrow"" without it thinking that I want to do that task by tomorrow or on tomorrow (for example)",positive
3292,"I've used all of the popular and some of the lesser known To Do List apps. This is by far my favorite. You don't have to have an account and has more options. But you should for back up purposes. The only problem I have is that when I miss a task, it says due 10 minutes ago when it's been 2 hours. My tasks do show up on time though. The times vary, but this issue started when I created an account.",positive
3293,"In my opinion this is The Best task management tool out there. FYI: I've tried Todoist, Nirvana, Notion, Microsoft To-Do, Wunderlist, Google Tasks, Any.Do. None of these apps had that many features that worked so well together as in TickTick. I use this app to plan my every day, and It's awesome! I don't have much money atm (pun intended) and can't get the premium, but free plan is offering so many features that it doesn't hinder my performance here, unlike in other apps.",positive
3294,"Please add 3rd party app integrations like Alexa, Microsoft outlook calendar, etc.",positive
3295,"Really nice clean UI and smooth UX, not laggy at all. You can divide tasks in groups and sub groups, and attach a due date to it and tell you when the task is overdue. The second best thing about this app is the ""plan"" app feature. The feature shows what task you have planned for the day and shows you the task one by one and lets you pick when to do it. Very nice feature but how many times you can plan your tasks is limited in the free version. I wish there's an integrated ""Habit App""feature",positive
3296,"It is simply one of the best productivity apps I've ever used,i would just go and give a five star,but i keep that last star cause living in my country i cant pay for the pro version and it kinda hurts that i see all the options I've missed,STILL thanks for all the great free options available",positive
3297,I really wish the calendar was available for non-premium members,positive
3298,LOVE this app - but I have two suggestions to make the habit function even better. Possible to implement please? 1) Interval tracking - e.g. do a habit every third day. Resets to third day following every time the habit is marked as done. 2) Track a habit less frequently than once per week e.g. once every two months. Will subscribe if the app has these two abilities!,positive
3299,"Really great app, fast and snappy like a to-do app should be like so you don't miss any thoughts, my biggest issue with this app is that there is no one time pay to buy option for it, while I find it useful I don't need a lot of the pro features, I am a basic user and need it just to track my personal tasks, as such the monthly payment subscription for the Pro version does not make sense to me, why not add a basic pro model, with limited features, that users can outright buy forever.",positive
3300,"After the latest update, when I click the 3 dots at the top right to delete a task, I can't pull the menu up to click the delete button",positive
3301,Very good experience. Does what we need.,positive
3302,"I wish this would sync with my Google task, so that i can use it on my computer and ipad.",positive
3303,"Excellent app that not only has to do check lists but habit tracking also covered, what I loved most about the app is the 'your thought' that pops after completing the habits...genuinely thank you for such app creator..",positive
3304,"I like the simple interface and it helps me set reminders for tasks, schedule them and analyse them.",positive
3305,This is a great app,positive
3306,Do you miss Astrid? Get this.,positive
3307,Pretty good!,positive
3308,So far so good,positive
3309,Not very intuitive sometimes but a useful app I use daily.,positive
3310,"Awesome app. Just want one feature, though, namely setting up the feature of an advanced timer for a task if one wants. Then will make the rating 5* from the current 4*.",positive
3311,Great app. I wish it had two features: the ability to add directly to a folder without having to move it. And the ability to resize the widget to a smaller height.,positive
3312,"Pretty good for me, but in the version I have I can't edit a task.",positive
3313,"The free version is very good so far. Most features are free. Ive only used a week, but if this app continues to be as useful, I'll consider premium soon.",positive
3314,Liked wunderlist better. Can't add more than one share. I wanted family grocery list.,positive
3315,Quite adequate for reminders ; Simple and easy to use.,positive
3316,"Ever since I downloaded this app, I've gotten less lazy, I've done more work, and I was able to keep track of my tasks needed. I would rate 5/5 stars, but I would like this app to have compatibility on windows or have some sort of chrome extension. If I am mistaken and there is a windows/chrome extension, please notify me. Thank you.",positive
3317,"I didn't understand how to add subtask in ""template"". I pressed ""save as template"", but it saved only the name of template. I couldn't find any information about template in ""help centre"". Please explain me how to add subtask in template.",positive
3318,The app is really good but there shouldn't be a premium version of this app it should be free.,positive
3319,Expensive,positive
3320,"Love TickTick, it's almost perfect! I'd love to see the following features added: • Subtasks within subtasks (like todoists) • Option to assign repeating tasks to repeat after completion rather than due date. (I have an automatic cat feeder that lasts five days then I need to be reminded, but if I postpone a day or two and then check it off it sets to repeat five days after the original due date instead of after I check off) • Option to configure inbox behavior (include tasks from other lists)",positive
3321,Good,positive
3322,MKBHD suggested this app. The free version is very good. Gets my work done.,positive
3323,new item menu for actions is horrible! please bring the old one back. delete action has a bad offset and is rendered behind the navigation bar. it's so inconvenient,positive
3324,I have been utilizing TickTick:ToDo List for awhile now. Its a very solid application that helps ensure the important tasks in one's life are completed on time.,positive
3325,Great app! Highly recommend it! I just wish this app would show the sub tasks in the to-do list.,positive
3326,I love this app. Only thing that annoys me is how marking a task as complete in one device doesn't dismiss notifications on the others.,positive
3327,Good apps. However I want to quit the subscription. Could u help me?,positive
3328,"This is a great app. The ine thing that would make it better would be if it worked with Google Assistant, Google Home, & Amazon Echo so I could make reminders in TickTick by voice.",positive
3329,Great app for task reminders. Reminders notifications works well. Easy to use.,positive
3330,This app is very helpful to me!,positive
3331,Would be great if all the features were free,positive
3332,Does what I need and makes remembering tasks very easy,positive
3333,Good program,positive
3334,How can I open pomo timer? 😢,positive
3335,The app works great as a digital day planner. The only complaint that I have. I dont see a way to edit tasks after I enter them.,positive
3336,Can't fully scroll to the bottom of the options list of a task. Can't see the delete option fully.,positive
3337,Good But need some options more Such as when you make one habit in different day at different time her can't help you,positive
3338,One of the best apps to boost your productivity. Replete with useful features even in the free version. Love their habit feature.,positive
3339,Great app. Ideal for planning ur day. Nice premium subscription,positive
3340,Very good,positive
3341,Love it,positive
3342,Very simple & easy to use reminder/list system. Not a lot of Fluff & Complications a lot of other programs like this do. But just switched from a 5 to a 4 star as security program showed all of my device info is being sent to Facebook servers in CA? Please tell me developer is not selling my info to Facebook??? Developer has not refuted this for quite a while now?,positive
3343,"This app does exactly what you need it to. Not perfect, but great at its job.",positive
3344,"Great app, but annoying that it limits the number of lists you can make. I can understand limiting *shared* lists on the free version, but not regular ones. Functionally it's great though. I would pay a one time fee to open the pro functions, but not ongoing fees.",positive
3345,Pretty good,positive
3346,Nice,positive
3347,Very useful and flexible for scheduling tasks. It can be better by employing ML to guess the best choice of time for any task.,positive
3348,Beautiful,positive
3349,Need at least few more levels of subtasks and lists for it to be perfect. Otherwise everything is good. Love it.,positive
3350,It would be more useful if user can provide interdependence and correlation between various actions and lists,positive
3351,It is very good app to manage your to do list. One thing that can make it better is it should show all the incomplete or overdue taks with todays tasks as overdue instead of into inbox. This will make those task more accessible and will keep them under notice.,positive
3352,Compared to Google Tasks it's overly complicated and too many menus to set simple things like dates and times.,positive
3353,"Please, solve the problem with fast typing! After I type in the date, letters and numbers REMAIN",positive
3354,Superb,positive
3355,Great app but is subscription based app.,positive
3356,"My all around power app! This app has been so useful, that I use it not just for tasks but also my calendar. Used to sync with Google calendar, but left that to be all Ticktick now. This app is right on the money.",positive

3362,It's better then the other apps I've tried. But there should a bottom where it says you couldn't do the task instead of just turning the task as an overdue.,positive
3363,One of the best To Do list apps I've used.,positive
3364,"amazing functionality; however, I wish there was a guide for some of the more advanced features.",positive
3365,"Very good, could have a little more utilities for the free version",positive
3366,Good hard to change times,positive

And it's been nothing short of amazing, life changing might sound like a stretch but it's helped me a tonne when it comes to getting stuffz done. - Only thing I'd ask for is more options or a separate way of planning things like a university timetable to make it faster to add classes etc.",positive
3378,Been using it for years and there have been tons of improvements! Great app. Just wish you could choose for notifications to come from top of screen instead of the bottom because many times a reminder pops up while I'm typing and I'll mistakenly dismiss it.,positive

3387,Very helpful for day to day activities,positive
3388,"I was so pleased with the new Habit tracker as well as using a true Dark Mode. However, I don't agree with the Premium policy as I prefer to make a bigger one-time payment (such as when I bought Final Cut Pro X with Apple) instead of a small recurring subscription that makes me want to go back to Todoist. It's a damn shame as I liked TickTick so much I'm willing to pay for Premium. Unfortunately, the subscription policy is an easy deal breaker.",positive
3389,"5.5.5.0: Habits widget improved but lacking. NEEDS ALSO SINGLE COLUMN LAYOUT for habits widget. THE GOOD: 1. SOME offline. 2. Habits. 3. Pomo timer. 4. Dark theme. 5. Sorting lists (only Paid). THE BAD: 1. Too expensive to use basic features. Make it $10 lifetime. 2. Social aspect sucks. Needs public leaderboard (OPEN to free users) & search find & add users. 3. Limited export feature. Use Titanium Backup. Share option ok but only one list, need full backup export all. 4. Need 100% offline mode",positive

3396,"I decided to update my review because the Tick tick team doesn't want to implement such a simple feature as 2AF protection. Many users asked then since 2018, but they use the same ""excuse"" every time: ""Our dev team hasn't such plan in my for this year."" Hello, it is 2020, the application that stores so much sensitive data, there must be 2FA.",positive

3398,"Great addition to having a calendar. I can set text reminders for To Dos from here so I don't have to clutter my family's digital calendar with details for my days. Took a while to get how the app and folders work, but I have a good system set up now.",positive
3399,"Great App, reliable and useful, however would be great if the kanban view was also available on mobile :) other than that I'm very satisfied with the app 👍",positive
3400,"Great application! I use it across all of my platforms, seamlessly. Keeps me organized for my day to day, week to week, month to month, and year to year tasks. I can attach documents, pictures, etc for all tasks which is very useful. Before TickTick, I used Toodeldo. It was okay, but TickTick is just leaps and bounds better than Toodeldo. If you want and need organization in your life, TickTick is the application for you!",positive
3401,"OK, I've finally found something to replace my beloved CloudCal and CloudTasks, which seem to have been abandoned, as the dev is communicating NOTHING to customers. TickTick, has a similar not that steep learning curve, but, once you catch on, it is fast, flexible, efficient, and gorgeous (I run the Dark mode.), which is actively updated. My new ""go to"" task manager and calendar. Great job, devs!",positive
3402,"Best to-do app I have used. It offers most of the features that other similar apps also offer, in a very simple user intefface: organize your tasks into lists, use tags, create smart lists, use two-way sync with Google Calendar. Finally, what makes it Excel over the competitors for me is that it also works as a daily/weekly planner, since the calendar view allows to drag and drop pending tasks into the day/week and also schedule start and end times for each task.",positive
3403,"Just got the app about a week ago after downloading and deleting multiple similar apps. TickTick works great, haven't had any problems with the app and it does everything it says it will do without asking you for additional money to use what was advertised as one of the features. This app has really helped me get my life more organized.",positive
3404,Wow! I tried many apps like this. And in my experience this app is the best one! So easy to use! After other apps with too many options and not understandable design this app is perfect! You just click '+' and enter the name! That's all! Of course if you want you can add time and date and something else. I recommend!,positive
3405,"I'm not usually one to advertise, but SERIOUSLY, if you are looking to be more organized with your daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, or random TASKS, then Tick Tick may be right up your alley. I downloaded it about a week ago as a suggested upgrade from the GTask Tracker app (which I liked a lot) and I absolutely love this app, for real!!",positive
3406,"Has every feature I could ask for in an app like this, and it's all executed perfectly. Leagues better than any of the other options. I do feel like $30 a year is steep for premium, though. For new users, know that premium is by no means necessary; It just gives you a little more capacity for random operations and unlocks some convenient functionality.",positive
3407,"Well designed, simple, yet powerful task list app. Has a great web app too, which works beautifully in tandem with the smartphone app. Use it on a daily basis and has also proved to be the best place to consolidate all my other lists (you know, the never ending list of lists that seems to keep growing...)",positive
3408,"The dream Task/Reminder app I have been looking for, and looking for a long time. UI, facilities, features are just amazing. Hopefully they don't ruin it by adding and updating it with pointless, unasked for features like so many other apps! I'll enjoy it while it's good! Also, please don't over saturate it with features like Essential PIM, was good at one point but now it's full of bugs and absolutely dire.",positive
3409,"Looked for replacement to wunderlist, found a much much better alternative. Ticktick is absolutely fantastic. Does everything wunderlist did, or I needed it to do, but much better. Built in integration for transferring wunderlist data over makes it so easy to start using and the layout and functionality is much more polished than wunderlist. Would highly recommend.",positive
3410,"Beautiful UI/UX design. Very easy to navigate and the developers keep adding useful features. If you're looking for an app with a to-do list feature and a pomodoro timer, TickTick is a great choice. I don't use the premium version and so far, I've still been able to access a lot of features. I highly recommend this app.",positive
3411,"It's a very good planner app. I had scoured the play store for dozens of planner apps, but none of their free versions were worth my time. This free version is entirely great on it's own and without any ads. However, if you're a student as I am, the duration feature for tasks on the premium app is definitely worth the $2.99 a month",positive
3412,"I was a longtime Wunderlist user, and briefly switched to Microsoft ToDo after I found out it was going to be gobbled up by Microsoft. After realizing that everything had to be within the Microsoft world to take advantage of full ToDo functionality, Iditched it and discovered TickTick. I would have used TickTick from the get-go if I knew it existed! This is an awesome app.",positive
3413,It has everything I need. Seemless synchronization across devices. Habit Tracker. Dark Theme. Calendar. And a whole lot more! I'm usually not a fan of paying monthly for a to-do app but this one is so well made I don't mind paying $2.99 monthly at all. Hoping to see some more themes in the future. :),positive
3414,"I've tried many productivity hacks, tools, and methods. This app is something that has stayed consistent throughout. It has everything you need in one place, no ads, and the pro features are for things that are extra, like for a company or team. My favorite part is how much you can customize every to-do list, folder and sub-folder to go with your personal style of working. Definitely worth downloading.",positive
3415,"This app is amazing! I use it for many tasks that are continuous and I mostly don't remember and it keeps me up to date with those tasks. I did have an inconvenience with the pomodoro timer being cancelled at the middle of it, but I do not use that feature a lot so I still give it a 5 star review",positive
3416,"I love the fact it covers different and very specific areas I need for my productivity - a daily task schedule with sub tasks - a calender to plan my roadmap, project lists for my work and to collaborate with my team, even assign tasks to them, and just recently, the new daily log in the habits is really helping me form new habits. I love the fact that most of the important features are free, it makes it easier to work with my team without them using premium like I do, and they learn it easily",positive
3417,"I like this app so much. It's user interface is simple and easy to use. In addition, it's a versatile app as it combines the features of many different applications, for instance, it's a to-do list, pomodoro, and a habit tracker. All in one. It has helped me alot to organise my life and I really appreciate it, so it deserves the 5 stars. I recommend this app to everyone.",positive
3418,"I love this app! I can set times, and my tasks will appear in that order. I can set several reminders. When I click Done, the task goes to the bottom under Completed. The app keeps track of my productivity. I like that I can group my tasks in categories. I especially like that when I click on the date, all of my tasks automatically appear. I don't have to be overwhelmed by how much I have to do. I just take 1 task at a time. There's even a Promo timer embedded to help me stay on track.",positive
3419,"The most intuitive app ever! Over the years I've tried numerous self-management techniques and apps, but this is the best by far. I love that it combines so many personal productivity functions in one, including Pomo timers, Kanban boards, habit tracker, smart reminders etc. Best by far is the minimalist, flexible calendar. The devs have done an incredible job! Update: Months later and I still love this and use it daily :)",positive
3420,"Phenomenal experience. It has everything I need including the ability to schedule recurring tasks which is something I was especially looking for in a to-do app. Happily paying monthly for this it has really helped. Though there are other habit tracking apps that I really like right now, I am also trying out their habit tracking feature",positive
3421,Needed a replacement for Wunderlist. Looked at several disappointing options before finding TickTick. It has everything I liked about Wunderlist plus it has nice extras like formatting in task notes and it lacks some of Wunderlist's annoying behaviors. It also did the best job importing from Wunderlist. The best alternative to Wunderlist. Period.,positive
3422,This was fantastic for my daily workplan. So easy to do. I was up and running after 10 minutes. Very easy to edit like move tasks to next day or another date if not complete. You can add real time to tasks helpful for setting up order of priority on list. You can select those tasks that repeat and set them up. It has an alarm reminder My husband downloaded it and can do many org things too. Get it.,positive
3423,"It's very good. Works on mobile and PC and it's easy to organize, you're able to nest lists, and it's easy to move them between lists or between different days. Several different options for viewing your tasks, by category, by priority, or by day or week.",positive
3424,"I'm a teacher and there are so many little things to do that pop up unexpectedly in my work. TickTick has helped ease the mental load of remembering them all, and it's more useful than a paper list as your phone is always handy. I think I even sleep better because I have less stress about keeping up with tasks. It's easy to reschedule tasks that you don't get to on a given day. I also enjoy the habit-forming function!",positive
3425,"So far so good! I've used other reminder apps. With ADD I have to have reminders of nothing would get done. This one let's me snooze the stuff I want to procrastinate on. Or if I need to be annoyed by the reminder, I can do that too. All around good app.",positive
3426,"Really helpful for daily scheduling, lists and calendar, and nicer look than competitors. Habit function could be smoother and stickier, with timed reminders and a quick check box like the tasks plus a visual of the streak -- don't need two steps and a graphic every time I take my vitamins.",positive
3427,"Absolutely replaced Wunderlist, for me. Devs are responsive to suggestions. With one or two extra features (richer data for pomodoros, a handful of 3rd-party integrations to handle automated tasks), TickTick could replace several other apps I use, too. Love it.",positive
3428,"I have been using this for a long time now and it's really useful for me especially when I need reminders to do certain things on a daily basis, or weekly. Though it can get annoying when you're doing something and it pops up but overall, it's an app i recommend!",positive
3429,"TickTick is complex enough that it can handle all the things I need to dump out of my brain, but simple enough that it gets out of my way and causes very little friction. It's a well polished app and offers quite a lot in the free version.",positive
3430,"By far the most streamlined and easy way to keep my tasks organized and clean, all in one place! I love the compatibility with Google Calendar. It's so simple and not as complicated as some other reminder apps. It just works.",positive
3431,"An amazing all in one; to-do list, pomodoro app, calendar app, habit tracker... I have made a video about it and all the people who have tried it, were impressed by it. I just love it. ❤️. Thinking truly about purchasing the full version.",positive
3432,"I really like ticktick, i have a decent memory but as a day goes on there is always something missed. I always set a task if i know it needs to get done amd and its done. Not to mention i have never had a single issue with the app not working.",positive
3433,It has everything I wanted! I really love the habit integration and at first I didn't know you could back date habits but you can so now I am very excited to use this app long term and see how it goes. Beautiful design too!,positive
3434,"I was a Todoist Premium user (loved Todoist) but the calendar view and list folders converted me over to TickTick Premium. I prefer TickTick's UI, widget, and task entry as well. If you like Todoist you'll like TickTick, but TickTick has some extra polish in places that I appreciate.",positive
3435,I used to use Todoist for years but after switching to Windows for my computer I realised how onesided their platform is. Ticktick is a great all rounder with all features available on all platforms and that makes it worth the subscription and 5 stars for me.,positive
3436,"After Microsoft announced the end of Wunderlist, I started using this app because of its similar UI and organizational capabilities. Been using it ever since with my girlfriend. Works for everything I need it to work for.",positive
3437,Just about the best when it comes to getting organized and planning your day to day tasks. Love having the option to collaborate with others and the Pomo timer is a real plus to stay focused on a specific task.,positive
3438,"This app is exceptionally great. I wanted to shift on Google tasks due to it's integration all over the place but this app is also cross platform compatible. TickTick is 1-2 steps away of being the ultimate app for daily task, habit management tool.",positive
3439,This application is the best for to do task. I think it is more than you expect it will fulfill your all requirements. it has most creative function that you haven't imagine. Thank you so much developers.,positive
3440,"Genuinely I have tried a bunch of different to do apps and this one is by far the best. Genuinely has every feature that you'd want, you can organise things in so many different ways. Big props.",positive
3441,"This is a really good app! Feature-rich free version, notifications work perfectly, several widgets to choose from, lists, and ability to share lists with other people - what else can i wish for?",positive
3442,"Still exploring the features but excellent and by far the best of the todos I've looked at. Addendum: having been using the app for a few months now, I can thoroughly recommend. Does everything that I need.",positive
3443,"Free version limits you to 9 checklists, but ad-free, intuitive and extensive functionality are totally worth it. Best feature IMO is shared lists and ability to assign tasks to certain people.",positive
3444,"Just does everything it should, allows you to configure alot but all the defaults are good, syncs across many platforms and allows you to email tasks. Much better than todoist and feels like wunderlist on steroids.",positive
3445,One of the best to do app in playstore. This combines the strength of GTD & pomodoro and lot of customization options. Hats off to the developers! You guys have really added value in my life through this app. Thank you.,positive
3446,Best Todo list/Organizational application I have found. I have tried many different apps like this one before finding ticktick. It's proven extremely useful for organizing my day to day tasks and chores.,positive
3447,so far? best alternative to Wunderlist I've found. works for my brain. great features. ad-free. synch. thank you to the developers for making all essential features free.,positive
3448,"I think it serves the purpose very well, as a ToDo list, with reminder categories functions. User interface is user-friendly too. Thanks!",positive
3449,Love this app. Very easy to use and has a great system of organizing tasks. Also the reminders are very helpful. Basically vital to my college experience.,positive
3450,"My life is a million times more organized with TickTick. I just wish that they'd do a one time payment rather than subscription, but I'm sure they've done their market research. Love them!",positive
3451,"The app I was using before was closing and changing into something else. So I did some research and this was very popular. Rightly so, as I prefer it to what I was using before. Great app",positive
3452,Just a awesome app!! Update: This app has really helped with my adhd! Still love the app. Now if I could do email from it. It would be the best app I have ever downloaded.,positive
3453,"This app has helped me organize my life and start habits that I've always been wanting to. Also, it has a pomo timer that helped me get many projects done. Great app!",positive
3454,The free version is all I need. It synchs with my calendar & offers alarms and reminders. Very easy access through the notification screen--one of its best features!,positive
3455,"Great way to track tasks. Reminders, priorities, repeating tasks are hugely helpful to keep me on top of what needs to be done.",positive
3456,I use this app as a recommendation from some writer in Medium. I've been using for a month and it's amazing. I can plan and complete all my tasks!,positive
3457,"I love the app, it's simple and efficient, with a smart interface that easily organizes my day. Support and Response is also quick and helpful.",positive
3458,Total game-changer. No glitches on the mobile version. Excellent filtering capabilities. Used it for 270 straight days and counting,positive
3459,"So helpful. Great way to keep track of tasks, notes, info, and appointments! Appreciate the cross-platform functionality ☺",positive
3460,"Excellent! Plan your day by the hour! This is what I've been looking for for years. Also, tick tick supports some amazing, innovative widget modes.",positive
3461,So easy to use. Really help me who's such an untidy person. There's a pomo and really help me to count how much time that I've spent in one session.,positive
3462,Love TickTick. It's the perfect organization tool for me. So well designed and has all the features I need. Well done!,positive
3463,Love this app. My favorite part is the helpful and intuitive snooze feature on tasks. Quick preset time ranges or ability to get specific make reminders easy to manage.,positive
3464,Tick Tick has been very easy to use and very handy. I use it for both business and personal use and find it very easy to collaborate lists with other people and create lists,positive
3465,Actually... It's pretty darn good. Yes you pay a subscription for full functionality but if you have a lot of projects and other stuff to track it's worth it. I also have to say that I love that there is a nice Chrome extension/widget (whatever)... so nice to be able to work on the desktop as well. Yes OneNote is good but honestly TickTick is much much better for tracking tasks with due dates IMO. Cheers!,positive
3466,Helps me at work soooo much! Perfect program. Can't think of anything that would make it better. I'm a type A list maker. Love it!,positive
3467,This app is actually good for daily routine. Things which I like :- 1. UI 2. Optimization 3. Functionality 4. Dark UI 5. No Ads 6. No charges,positive
3468,Such an incredible app made my life well organised well Handful notification settings are pretty good i think you really don't need the pro subscription and if u use it alot then u can go for it for students like me its pretty much get the work done,positive
3469,"Pretty good so far. It does just what I need. Widgets, attachments, small line below the main description,... I just miss the undo feature the free version had.",positive
3470,Perfect! A Calendar with the opportunity to create notes for everyday or other notes on the side. I just love it!,positive
3471,"Fantastic task list for personal and teams, calendar, pomodoro timer, and habit tracker. This one app does pretty much everything, it's fantastic.",positive
3472,One word to describe this app is AMAZING. Ultimate app for to-do and habit tracking. After many years a single app has impressed me so much. Highly recommended 👍,positive
3473,"I get notifications on time, and this app has various features, including pomodoro, all in one. Super happy with the present.",positive
3474,"Simple and intuitive. I don't even know for sure how long I've been using TickTick, but at the time I tried multiple free to-do list apps, and this one was by far my favorite. It allows my tasks to auto reset on a schedule of my choice. I get reminders for the day, but can also set reminders ahead of time (down to a specific time of day if preferred).",positive
3475,Went very well before my payment for my premium subscription can not be proceeded. Please help me fix this issue. Thank you.,positive
3476,"I use the app daily for routine planning and habit tracking. Multi-device app with constant improvements by the developer, the app keeps on getting better",positive
3477,Have been using this since 15+ days. A must have app those who focus on being productive everyday. Habit tracker is a big plus. Kudos to the team.,positive
3478,Syncs across Android and iOS devices. Can manage tasks and arrange them according to priority and has a file management system for different tasks needed.,positive
3479,"So far, I am in love. This is exactly what I have been searching for to organize all of my todos. The folder feature is the best and I think this will finally bring me into the world of digital calendars. Not to mention the feedback feature is super helpful to instantly get you on the right track with how things work.",positive
3480,"These guys rock, I had to switch my rating to 5 stars. Since I pay for premium the app improved a lot. I also tired other well known apps but I think this one is the best right now 👍👍👍",positive
3481,"Excelent app, use it daily. Sortable tasks, sortable sub tasks, many reminder options. See only what you need to do today, or this week, or customize date using widget. Paid version is worth it too. I have had the servers go down a couple of times in the last few months, may change rating of it becomes a regular problem.",positive
3482,Super helpful and has definitely increased my productivity as a student. Would have loved to have discovered it years ago. Great job devs!,positive
3483,I really like this app! It has many options for personal organization and is more helpful than any other app I've tried yet.,positive
3484,"Nothing better. Not sure how many years I have used this, 5+ years @least, I have tried everything out there, but nothing works as well. First, it's easy. Second, it's minimal, I don't spend more time setting up, organizing, etc. I spend my time doing what I need, not taking time in the app Third, it's every where I need to access it. Is just easy and fast and I particularly love the reminder feature. I used it free for awhile, but have happily had premium for years.",positive
3485,"Latest update corrected a previous issue, and developer was very good about replying to my messages. Use this app every day.",positive
3486,"This App Has Made Our Lives So Much Easier! My husband and I have two kids under 3 which means we have to schedule daycare drop offs/pick up's, packing lists, doctors appointments, prep for soccer/swimming/gymnastics. This app has brought the closest thing to order we can have in our chaotic lives. Our friends have seen how we used it and downloaded the app for themselves as a result. Highly recommend using it as a shared task list with your spouse!!",positive
3487,"A very useful app. It helps timely completion of your tasks. Thanks a lot, developers.",positive
3488,"I have used Wunderlist for about 5 years, but now its being retired. I tested and tried 10+ apps since then, and none were that great. I stumbled upon TickTick, and wish I had started using it years ago. TickTick has much greater customization options, and does a great job of incentivizing completion of tasks via feedback. It has made my life much easier. I do wish the widget had options to change how it appears, the ""to dos"" do not have breaks between them.",positive
3489,"I love this app! I can literally organize my entire life with this app and not worry about it. I make grocery lists, set reminders for appointments, create subtasks, and this isal all with the free version. If I need to make other arrangements I can do that with a few adjustments with the date and time. This is the first app I've seen in several years that may be worth the paid version. Just what I need!",positive
3490,"There is all-in-one combine. I absolutely excited. All function realized perfectly. ✅ Pomodoro ✅ Tasks, subtusks, folders ✅ Calendar ✅ Availability to see all completed tasks in calendar ✅ Stats ✅ Formated description (numerical lists, bold, headers etc) All I need I have in this app. I little bother about restrictions for free version. Monthly price is high enough for my using case. But nowadays I don't need to buy full version. App is brilliant, I have checked a lot of todo/dairy/organizers",positive
3491,"It is not an exaggeration to say that the colorful, customizable, syncable, endlessly-useful TickTick has changed my workflow, productivity, & life. There are some improvements I've hoped they'd make -- the ability to determine an est. amt of time for a task (aside from Pomodoro/calendar); including a habit tracker in the computer software in addition to the phone -- but it's 5 stars even with those elements lacking, and that's why I am a loyal customer who has recommended it to everyone I know.",positive
3492,Moved to TickTick when Wunderlist announced it would become Microsoft ToDo. I'm loving it so far. Better than Wunderlist. Specially the web app.,positive
3493,Incredibly useful app. Very good for making lists. Not that great for habit forming but that's fine.,positive
3494,"This app does EXACTLY what I need it ""to do""! I love that it integrates with Google Chrome ams synchronizes across all of my devices! 5 stars!",positive
3495,this app helps me stay organized with my online work during quarantine. it reminds of assignments that are overdue and lets me set priorities for each assignments. really helpful app if you're a procrastinator like i am.,positive
3496,"This is exactly what I needed. The customizations are really in-depth and very helpful. I opted for the 2.99/mo subscription and so far it's already worth it. It's like a better version of Google calendar. Look at your daily routine and upcoming tasks at a glance. It's super intuitive. Within a half hour I set up my daily routine and upcoming events with absolutely no problems at all. If you're a busy person and need a way to organize your life, this is the app you need.",positive
3497,"I could rate this app with 6 stars, it is the best task manager app I've found ever and it is cross-platform, nice work!!",positive
3498,"This app is simply the best for organising yourself. It's so customisable, I really love how you can not only set exact times and dates, you can then get those reminders to repeat however you want - do you want to be reminded every second Wednesday of the month? No problem. Do you want reminders only during weekdays? Sure! Also, my love for this app has grown considerably since I found out you can set location based reminders - and you don't even have to pay for it! Fantastic app, A++",positive
3499,"Tried a few different apps over 2 years but always came back to TickTick. Works well for me, aligns to me needs and I find it intuitive. I'd recommend, especially since it offers a lot of features which are premium in others apps. Unsolicited advice to anyone looking for a to-do app: there is no app that works best, no one-size-fits-all. Unfortunately you need to test a bunch and decide which works best for you.",positive
3500,This has made my life so simpler and better. Amazing planner app. Sync across all the devices. Sub task can be added. Task can be allotted to your team. This is superb. They deserve much more appreciation then they get.,positive
3501,"Perfect for a busy bee! I do a lot in a day, this app helps me categorize my time on my busiest days by setting times, dates and reminders for all my tasks that need to get done, love it!",positive
3502,This app have everything from UI to Features without costing much..Best in the market.,positive
3503,Best to-do app I've come across.,positive

3511,Most productive application,positive
3512,Love this apps. Would be great if can aks before delete task,positive
3513,"seems to be usable, i am too accustomed to wunderlist, i wish i could star items to be put on a starred list",positive
3514,Best App,positive
3515,Enables you to sandwich your productivity in double slices of focus. It's definitely my go-to planner.,positive
3516,Great app,positive
3517,"The best app in this area. I could only suggest that a functionality is tracking the progress of a task could be offered (a board with doing, blocked, completed, etc columns)",positive
3518,"I love this app, it keeps me organized and is simple to use. It has a lot of features in the free version but isnt too complicated. Some apps try to do too much, not this one, it does what I need and it does it well. I love the feature to make lists or schedule tasks, set a tasks priority, or quickly move it to tomorrow when I've over scheduled myself. Highly recommend.",positive
3519,Great!,positive
3520,Amazing,positive
3521,Best to do list app better than anything,positive
3522,Best tasks app ever . Clean interface . Does the job perfectly,positive
3523,"An all in one app for todo lists, remainders, habit trackers and pomodoro timer. And i haven't even bought the premium version yet.",positive
3524,Best task app. In free version very useful. I hope they don't disable options what are now for free.,positive
3525,"After many years of Android, finally found the perfect task app. Plenty of category and reminder options, and seamless sync to the cloud with a web based interface.",positive
3526,"Great app! A good replacement for Wunderlist. Supports all platforms, and has all the important feature whilst remaining very easy to use (unlike some of the competition). I would love having a slightly better widget. The current one doesn't look very good (the tasks aren't in boxes), and there's not a good support for RTL writing. I suggest aligning the text to the Left even when having RTL text, so every task is on the Left side and it's not mixed up.",positive
3527,Amazing app. Beats the even best ones out there. Good work. Keep it up.. keep improving..,positive
3528,Very helpful,positive
3529,Too good.,positive
3530,"This app is great for everyday planning: to plan shopping or fast task, equally good for planning big projects. Keeping on track with your habits and stay focused with Pomo. Fast, powerful, lite",positive
3531,This just helps structure your life so better....,positive
3532,I'm pretty picky with task apps - TickTick is one of the best I've used. Good functionality with flexible usage models.,positive
3533,It's very good apps,positive
3534,Love for scheduling but MORE for grocery lists!,positive
3535,Really great. Since I had installed this application I can do my works on time and very well.,positive
3536,"It is inviting, which makes it very usable.",positive
3537,"Amazing app. Perfect blend of features and polish. One thing I gotta appreciate is that even to new users who haven't decided on subscription yet, it's so clean. No in-the-face BUY ME messages. It's so clean. And polite. The subscription is totally worth it since it really does offer that much. Love it. Kudos to the team and community for making it what it is.",positive
3538,The best planner app I've ever used,positive
3539,It's really a great app which can help you organize your day and be more productive 💙,positive

3555,Something great 💞,positive
3556,"Finally, a simple planner that works for me!",positive
3557,"It's very good. Works on mobile and PC and it's easy to organize, you're able to nest lists, and it's easy to move them between lists or between different days. Several different options for viewing your tasks, by category, by priority, or by day or week.",positive
3558,Best in the business👍👍,positive
3559,Best to do list app. I've tried so many to do list app bit this is certainly the best!,positive

3568,So easy to use. Really help me who's such an untidy person. There's a pomo and really help me to count how much time that I've spent in one session.,positive
3569,Best free version todo list app,positive
3570,"I have been using this for a long time now and it's really useful for me especially when I need reminders to do certain things on a daily basis, or weekly. Though it can get annoying when you're doing something and it pops up but overall, it's an app i recommend!",positive
3571,I use this app as a recommendation from some writer in Medium. I've been using for a month and it's amazing. I can plan and complete all my tasks!,positive
3572,Wow! I tried many apps like this. And in my experience this app is the best one! So easy to use! After other apps with too many options and not understandable design this app is perfect! You just click '+' and enter the name! That's all! Of course if you want you can add time and date and something else. I recommend!,positive
3573,Have been using this since 15+ days. A must have app those who focus on being productive everyday. Habit tracker is a big plus. Kudos to the team.,positive
3574,Just a awesome app!! Update: This app has really helped with my adhd! Still love the app. Now if I could do email from it. It would be the best app I have ever downloaded.,positive
3575,Perfect! A Calendar with the opportunity to create notes for everyday or other notes on the side. I just love it!,positive
3576,Simple and efficient,positive
3577,Needed a replacement for Wunderlist. Looked at several disappointing options before finding TickTick. It has everything I liked about Wunderlist plus it has nice extras like formatting in task notes and it lacks some of Wunderlist's annoying behaviors. It also did the best job importing from Wunderlist. The best alternative to Wunderlist. Period.,positive
3578,Very useful application. Intuitive and lots of features. Thanks!,positive
3579,Simply the best app for productivity. Best user interface out there and best reminder service. Offers great widgets too.,positive
3580,Cool,positive
3581,Great! Easy to use!,positive
3582,Love this app. My favorite part is the helpful and intuitive snooze feature on tasks. Quick preset time ranges or ability to get specific make reminders easy to manage.,positive
3583,It's a really great app👍👍,positive
3584,The best app for planning I met.,positive
3585,Very useful.,positive
3586,best to-do app,positive
3587,Tick Tick has been very easy to use and very handy. I use it for both business and personal use and find it very easy to collaborate lists with other people and create lists,positive
3588,"It's a very good planner app. I had scoured the play store for dozens of planner apps, but none of their free versions were worth my time. This free version is entirely great on it's own and without any ads. However, if you're a student as I am, the duration feature for tasks on the premium app is definitely worth the $2.99 a month",positive
3589,Great apk,positive
3590,Loved the way to add due time of tasks,positive
3591,It's a wonderful app,positive
3592,Excellent !!!,positive

3600,"I love it except, and this is a big issue for me, it's totally server based. Want to update anything, but have a bad internet connection? Too bad, it's either going to take forever or fail. I would use and maybe even pay for this app to just have a way to have everything first be saved on my device.

You can manually edit values within the app for stats making any it unreasonable that I need internet.",negative
3601,Buggy as all hell. The advertisement is right. It gamifies tasks... But that's it. No tracking history of your habits. Inaccurate as all hell. Worst of all is you can't delete your account.

3614,Unfortunately i can not sign up or sign in. By google account or email. I tried a lot. From iran,negative
3615,"App broken, don't bother. Like many many other reviewers, this app is totally broken and defunct on Android devices and specifically Galaxy S10 / Note 10 devices. It seems the developer response to all of those reviews is ""please report a bug"" but this has now been an issue for months that they haven't looked into fixing despite dozens of notifications from users that their app is broken. I have instead now downloaded an app by another developer which actually works. I will not be back.",negative
3616,"I had really begun to depend on this app and was having fun. Then I downloaded the update. I now have NOTHING. Not even the IMAGE of an avatar, there's just NOTHING THERE. I have no experience, no level, no coins, NOTHING. I was having a really awful day and this was just icing on the cake. There was so much I put into this game. How can I remember all of the tasks I scheduled for myself? I am so so discouraged.",negative
3617,Same issue as Don Smith who wrote a review on 10/10/19. Will consider this app but the lack of slide visuals and character visuals makes the app in-op. Current phone is the Google pixel 4xl......perhaps I misspoke in regards to the reply. My issue is not with the visuals but the lack of visuals. Everything is blank for me so literally can not see half of the content.,negative
3618,You need internet access and the server has to be up on their side for you to be able to access your to-do list. Server has been down today and I cant check off or edit my to-do list due to that. Going to be deleting this app. Most other to-do lists work offline.,negative
3619,"Can't even log in. Seems to stop working or freeze up every time. Just downloaded the app for the first time, can't make a new account or log in. Waste of time, will be looking for other apps that actually let me get past the log in screen.",negative

I was excited by the premise and motivated to start using it, but the experience was downright embarrassing. I'd love for a developer response here to acknowledge these problems and maybe offer some solutions.",negative
3632,"Great concept, but I can't even create an avatar. This is a constant bug listed in reviews. The company says that your selections should show up after you start actually using the app, but how can they when we can't even actually CHOOSE anything. I guess I'll try one of the competitors apps.",negative
3633,"I really want to use this app, but on my Galaxy S10, the first 2 of the 3 slides in the introduction before logging in, are blank. The character visuals on the character customization are invisible, and on the settings menu, I scroll down and the options start to overlap each other (hard to describe). I will consider reinstalling after the graphical issues are fixed because it seems like a great app, but currently it's unusable for me.",negative
3634,This app has some major problems. It seemed to work fine for the first day of running. After the first day no reminders were executed. Any game armor or weapons could never be equipped. it appeared you could equip them but once you left the screen they become unequipped and they never showed up on the avatar. I mainly got this app for productivity and since the reminders do not work I'm not certain I'm going to continue using it unless these problems are fixed.,negative
3635,"My phone is a Samsung S8+. The introduction screen is mostly blank, and the character customization seems to be broken because your character and customization options don't show up. I didnt go any further.",negative
3636,Quite disappointed with this app. Is used to be fine for past years. Currently is really slow when checking my task and is so frustrating at times. This app need improvement on the server and at times server down :(.,negative
3637,"As soon as I downloaded the app and made a new account, I couldn't create a new character because under the body, skin, and other options to make your character was blank. When I changed my display name, I got a weird message for 'profile.name' required. The randomize button didn't even work for me either. I left originally because there were many bugs with to-do's and other things and I'm not confident it's functional past the character creator, so I don't see a point to continue. On the S10E",negative
3638,"Busted from the start. On the first open of the app I got a 3 pane swipe intro and the first 2 were blank purple screens. Then, on the Avatar creation screen the Avatar wasn't visible. When finally getting in to the app the ""help text"" bubble didn't point at anything, just the bottom of the screen for the whole dialogue. This app sounded interesting but it seems there's a complete lack of interest in quality.",negative
3639,"Downloaded this app hoping for a fun way to form new habits, but when I get to the register screen the first two tutorial panels are blank and then the third one lets you link social media accounts. Then I can't save the username and display name I create, and the avatar generator screen doesn't load any options. Opened the app the next day to find nothing I could edit had been saved. Uninstalled and tried registering again with a different account and got the same results. Pretty disappointed",negative
3640,App has no images on S10+ and is completely unusuable,negative
3641,"I kept getting empty screens when opening the app, so I pressed skip. Filled out the registry info and was taken to character creation where I couldn't see my character or the build options. I could select things like body or hair, but nothing appeared relating to that.",negative
3642,"This seems like a fun idea, and was recommended to me as especially helpful for people with ADHD, so I was intrigued. Unfortunately, I have encountered a bug where when I get to the screen where I choose my screen name and username, I cannot press the next button after filling out the name and username. Then, when I exit the app and go back to it, it's the default character and I cannot customise it/my account.",negative
3643,"DL'd to try this app out, but could not get past the initial setup. Buttons missing labels or information, lethargic loading issues, and the graphics are really sub par for what other games host currently. Even the initial avatar appearance has most things locked behind a pay wall, and keeps putting me in a wheelchair! The idea behind the app has a lot of potential, and would be a joy to see if they can make it better and working properly. Will have to wait and see. As is? Not functional.",negative
3644,"I really wanted to love this app. It looks amazing & has so much potential. However, the app does not sync to your timezone. My day does not reset at midnight, despite what the app says. When I try to change the reset time to match up with the incorrect timezone, it keeps switching back to midnight. So my day randomly resets, usually around 6 or 7 pm. Sometimes, the day doesn't reset for more than 24 hours. & my avatar takes damage for the ""missed"" day. Makes it impossible to effectively use. :(",negative

3648,"Pretty disappointed that the first wall I hit is having to login or register. I get the whole cloud saving thing but at least give me the option and let the risk fall on me for data loss. The app looked promising and I was really impressed with the bit of pixel art I got to see. However, I'm not sure I want to sign up and allow access to my details or habits just yet.",negative
3649,I downloaded this app because I thought that the game concept for to-do lists would be really cool. Opened the app just after downloading and tried to register an account and it wouldn't let me log in. Waited another hour and it still wasn't working. Call me impatient but I just couldn't use an app that refused to work.,negative
3650,"Need to be online to use this app. In case you make changes in offline mode. It doesn't sync automatically when online. You need to again make those changes. Enable offline feature and offline data should be synced when ever we are online. Once this is done, you got my 5 star.",negative
3651,"Ever get a phone call from a Salesman whom you don't remember giving your phone number out to? this is the app that does it. it reads your phone number and identity and uploads it to the cloud where it can later be sold to the highest bidder. this app makes sure that it gets your identity because you have to login before you can even use it. once you log in, the game is a huge disappointment. mypoli has everything over this.",negative
3652,"Just starting and learning how to use. Unable to set correct due date on tasks. When I select that task has a due date, todays date appears. When I click that date the calendar displays. Allgood so far. But when I select a date on the calendar and close it, the due date is still today.",negative
3653,Requires being online to use. Which is a shame because it looks like a fun way to get motivated. Would use if it didn't require constant network or wifi connection (I live and work in rural areas) . Had to uninstall due to inability to use throughout the day.,negative
3654,It's broken. I try to create my account and I can't even use the name I want or customize my character. It's just broken. Nothing displays.,negative
3655,"First thing I did when I installed the app was disable notifications and yet I still get constantly spammed with notifications all day long. That aside, the app is poorly made. UI is very buggy. Chat functions are glitchy and don't update mezsages correctly. Sometimes the main ui responds to nothing. You can switch tabs and nothing changes till you close and open the app again. Almost all fun and worth while content is locked behind a paywall or subscription.",negative
3656,App is no longer functional. Cant even Start app without it malfunctioning. Cant change username or character. It was fine before the update!,negative
3657,"There seems to be no way to actually mark a task as complete, so I had to delete the tasks I actually did complete and therefore have not gotten in-game rewards. There is also no way at all to contact support. If you join the Habitat Help Guild that is supposed to allow you to ask questions, there is no obvious way to post a question there. There is a button to leave the guild but not one to post a question. This app is terrible and is a waste of time.",negative
3658,"I have been wanting to try out this app for a while. I registered, and everything is going great until i get to the character maker screen. i am unable to see my charcter and the customization options. Will send photos if needed. Will change rating once this is fixed.",negative

Weirdly enough, the web version works on my laptop using the same WiFi. Please fix. --Update 1--: Reinstalled app. Apparently login with Google is completely broken. Not working at all.

It seems the developer response to all of those reviews is ""please report a bug"" but this has now been an issue for months that they haven't looked into fixing despite dozens of notifications from users that their app is broken.

Uninstalled and tried registering again with a different account and got the same results. Pretty disappointed",negative
3737,Same issue as Don Smith who wrote a review on 10/10/19. Will consider this app but the lack of slide visuals and character visuals makes the app in-op. Current phone is the Google pixel 4xl......perhaps I misspoke in regards to the reply. My issue is not with the visuals but the lack of visuals.

Any game armor or weapons could never be equipped. it appeared you could equip them but once you left the screen they become unequipped and they never showed up on the avatar. I mainly got this app for productivity and since the reminders do not work I'm not certain I'm going to continue using it unless these problems are fixed.,negative

3801,"Good app, but very buggy and support is completely unhelpful. There's no way to change your subscription level in the app or play store. Even if you cancel the app will think you're still subscribed. So basically when you pick a subscription level you are fully committed to it because the devs are too incompetent and uncaring to help. When using a choosing skill the habits n dailies show up like 10% of the time and the devs basically said ""oh well, we can't fix that"" when I mentioned it.",negative

3805,"The idea is wonderful. But a lot of tedious mistakes spoil the whole impression. For example, information is slowly updated even within the application, often clicking on a menu item is ignored.

Well, the old-school 8-bit graphics - not everyone likes it.",negative
3806,"Great concept, but really quite bad execution. With so many bugs even in the new player introduction it feels like an early access, not v2.2 of anything. Surprised to learn that it's been in public release for 4 years now. I would be ashamed to make or spend money from any transaction within this game. I'm not usually this harsh, and I hope none of the devs take this review personally, but get it together. Needs a major QOL & UX overhaul before I would consider the concept v1.0 complete.",negative

Why you people would choose to have it so if you use ""log in using Google"", it resets and begins a whole new account without asking, now I have two accounts on one email? It won't even give me my password! I tried resetting it several times. How annoying, bad design. After I spent so much time on the app too, all for it not to work",negative
3812,I really liked this until I realized that unfinished daily/repeating tasks get marked as done whether you complete them or not the next day. That makes it pretty useless for tracking tasks I need to do each week.,negative

3818,fun and helpful. graphics are awesome. just needs a few tweaks. too easy to cheat. i don't like the tavern because i am in recovery from drugs and alcohol so it's kinda anthemic. maybe a temple option would be a better social forum for inclusion for those of us who don't drink and/or use drugs. it would also be nice if you could continue to see completed to-do items after you have checked them so you can continue to visualize your progress.,negative
3819,"Despite various updates to ""fix bugs"" the first few screens of this app are still completely broken on Android. The app beyond sign-in still functions...but that's it.

Just deleted my account thru the website.",negative
3825,"I honestly didn't get much chance to use the app before it stopped connecting and not letting me do anything. Before that happened i started setting up daily tasks and the part where you set how often (such as the days of the week) you do each task was confusing. I would change the days on one task and it would change it for all of them. Over all, too much work for its worth. Loved the idea though, it would have really gotten me doing things to level up and collect items",negative
3826,"I wanted to use this app. The concept is really good. But I won't use it simply because it barely functions. For starters it's online only... but as if that wasn't enough the sync on Android is just all over the place - the app would sometimes ask ""have you done these things today?"" for tasks that were scheduled the day before or at 1 AM for tasks on that day... Speaking of tasks, I couldn't set up multiple repeating tasks for certain days of the week (per task, wanted to fill the whole week with various tasks and repeat them) for some reason, they would all sync to same weekdays. I enabled reminders but never had a reminder come up once and as far as I researched online this is a common problem on Android and hasn't been resolved for some time. So it seems I have to create a habit of opening this habit tracker app...",negative
3827,"Boring and not very effective for me: the visual design is a bit of a yawn and it's too hard to earn rewards without paying. If it works for you, great but it doesn't give me enough gratification.",negative
3828,"This app is a great idea with poor execution. Reminders only sometimes appear, and the UI can be very unresponsive - I've checked daily tasks off, only to find that the app interpreted this as UNchecking the task (since it hadn't registered the fact that it is a new day, yet), which actually subtracts the game resources from you. These problems are significant enough to make the RPG-like rewards system ineffective for me, and the app not worth using as a habit-tracker at this time, sadly.",negative
3829,"This app would be so much better if it didn't penalize you for doing your habits for many days in a row. Instead of getting more experience, coins, you get less the longer you do something. You should be rewarding the habits that people are building, not telling them that once they have the Habit they're going to get less for it. Otherwise, this app would get five stars for me.",negative
3830,"I'm a breath away from uninstalling this app again. Half the time it doesn't even do what it's supposed to do, some things it doesn't even let you do inside the app, you have to go to the actual browser version to do it. On that subject, the mobile browser is beyond awkward, no chance of navigating it properly! If I'm supposed to log into an actual PC just to check off that I did a workout or washed dishes, forget it. Right now the only reward I get is having my good mood ruined; certainly not worth it.",negative
3831,"I love the idea of this app. Unfortunately, it is not super user friendly. I've been using it for over a month and it is not very obvious how to complete quests or anything else. (and yes, I have gone through the FAQs) I finally figured out how to hatch eggs, but that's all. It's a pretty clunky app as a ""game"" but it does a pretty good job of keeping me accountable for things. That's the only reason I haven't deleted it. As a ""Gamify your life"" app, I'm not convinced. Hopefully it improves!",negative
3832,"Great concept, but riddled with bugs. Sign up was horribly difficult, with the servers not responding and the app failing to realize I was trying to change my username and display names. App reset at around 7:00 pm, instead of at midnight of my time zone, which I had double checked beforehand. I want to like it, but this is becoming downright frustrating.",negative
3833,"Needs a VPN if you're in China. Some questionable UI and design choices, though the fundamentals work well for the most part. If you want to do anything remotely interesting then you have to pay, of course. And the subscription fees are absolutely extortionate. One month is the same price as a month of Netflix and a year is £47. A year of MS Office 365 with all of its functionality is £60... Let that sink in. I don't understand why, for relatively little, this app costs so much. Greed, I assume.",negative
3834,"This app is either really good or really bad/broken --- there are no in betweens. I love the concept, and its super cute, but it bugs out quite a bit and besides which, is super easy to misclick on. As a result, I've lost or accidentally lost items, as well as accidentally spending nearly all of my coins completely on accident because there's no verification for buying and no refunding??? And that's besides the part where it constantly unequips all of my gear... This game needs help...",negative
3835,"It would be a very helpful app if it actually worked the way you'd expect... if I say I want a task to be weekly, but make it so I can complete that task any day, what I'm trying to do, is make the task flexible, so I can do the weekly task whatever day of the week I feel like, instead however, making it available everyday turns it into a daily task, which I will be punished for by not completing daily, my only real solution at the moment is filling up my to-do list which is really frustrating.",negative
3836,"Just had a big visual update but if anything the app is getting worse and worse. Now most of the time when I tap a plus sign to increase count of something, nothing happens.

I've mostly stopped using it because of this.",negative
3837,used it awhile ago and recently installed on my new phone. as soon as it opened it was clear i would not be able to use it. several things where off (like trying to put pictures in an office doc) worse still when i try to add many options are cut off by some form of white box that sits in the way. unfortunately dailies are one of the missing options and a huge part of how i personally used the app.,negative
3838,"it's a great idea but it just doesn't work! The pages never refresh for the next day, and if i press the refresh button it just comes up with an unable to connect to server error, or just stays with the loading symbol infinitely.

The ""refill health"" prompt kept repeatedly popping up and then when it stopped my health bar was still at zero. Also the add habit button isnt there always...",negative
3839,Very buggy first few times that I've used the app. Repeatedly having to close and reopen it for it to properly work.,negative
3840,Heres the thing. I love this app and the idea behind it. But for some reason its so dang glitchy. Pages wont always change when i scroll. Tasks dont refresh. I often have to completely close the app. Help! Very willing to change this review to 5 stars if we get this figured out.,negative
3841,I really enjoy this app but it has just stopped working randomly. I tried to hatch a dragon egg and the app crashed and since then I cant access it.

I am very dissapointed as I really like the idea of the app.,negative
3842,"I quite like habitica, but this app has some issues. The biggest problem for me is that switching the to do list to ""Scheduled"" is supposed to sort the to do items by due date (that's how it works on the website), but it doesn't. That makes the to do list (in the app) useless for me.",negative
3843,"To be honest, it's a really good app. It has everything (simplicity, system, ui, etc.) but seriously, if this is really a productivity app, it needs to have an offline mode. Does it really need to have an internet connection every time someone has to check their to do list?",negative
3844,"latest update has not fixes bugs that occur every day.frustrating to use.sometimes it won't save,will just have a loading loop.Some basic things are not customizable like the calendar starting on Monday or the date format ,doesn't keep track of activity data correctly .

3845,"Very nice and interesting concept but completely useless because you flipping need wifi to update your checklist?! Furthermore even if my parents didn't control my wifi and I had full access, there should be a way to see all your tasks etc at a glance without having to scroll so much.

3901,fun and helpful. graphics are awesome. just needs a few tweaks. too easy to cheat. i don't like the tavern because i am in recovery from drugs and alcohol so it's kinda anthemic. maybe a temple option would be a better social forum for inclusion for those of us who don't drink and/or use drugs. it would also be nice if you could continue to see completed to-do items after you have checked them so you can continue to visualize your progress.,negative

3905,"Despite various updates to ""fix bugs"" the first few screens of this app are still completely broken on Android. The app beyond sign-in still functions...but that's it.

I prefer apps like Fabulous, which I think approaches the subject of mental health and habit forming in a much better way.",negative
3906,Set up was glitchy. I didnt get further than that. It's a great concept though and the art is cute.,negative
3907,"Good app, but very buggy and support is completely unhelpful. There's no way to change your subscription level in the app or play store. Even if you cancel the app will think you're still subscribed. So basically when you pick a subscription level you are fully committed to it because the devs are too incompetent and uncaring to help. When using a choosing skill the habits n dailies show up like 10% of the time and the devs basically said ""oh well, we can't fix that"" when I mentioned it.",negative

Almost froze when scrolling through habits. I gave it more time to load, then tried going to a different section of the app & it crashed.. 11/9/19) Would be an awesome app, if it would load.

3917,"Would you quit directing me to the website!? If I want to join a party/guild it should be done on the app. It won't let me log in on the site AT ALL..

3919,"The idea is wonderful. But a lot of tedious mistakes spoil the whole impression. For example, information is slowly updated even within the application, often clicking on a menu item is ignored.

Well, the old-school 8-bit graphics - not everyone likes it.",negative

3921,I really liked this until I realized that unfinished daily/repeating tasks get marked as done whether you complete them or not the next day. That makes it pretty useless for tracking tasks I need to do each week.,negative

3930,"Great concept, but really quite bad execution. With so many bugs even in the new player introduction it feels like an early access, not v2.2 of anything. Surprised to learn that it's been in public release for 4 years now. I would be ashamed to make or spend money from any transaction within this game. I'm not usually this harsh, and I hope none of the devs take this review personally, but get it together. Needs a major QOL & UX overhaul before I would consider the concept v1.0 complete.",negative

4001,"I've been using Habitica for a few years now and while I love the idea, from a technical standpoint the mobile app is broken. It feels like something you would have on your phone back when touchscreens were a new thing. The most annoying bugs are: party screen not updating after you accept a quest invitation so you're not sure if you accepted it, spamming buffs sometimes reduces your mana without actually applying the buff and party chat not updating (have to restart the app to see new messages)",neutral
4002,"It's fun, a great concept, but the app itself needs work. It locks up constantly and has to be manually shut down and then re-started, and the reminders basically don't work at all.

It's just missing so I end up with a female characters. I have Galaxys10 and tried reinstalling app but nope, seems to be just a bug. Also, changing outfits just seems terrible to scroll through (the not user friendly part) The Good Idea is amazing! I really want this app to improve so I can incorporate this into my daily life.",neutral

But, I wish that it showed you past dates and all you accomplished on days previous, and I wish that the coloring of tasks wasn't so complicated when getting close to red or blue or whatever.

I try to keep my list in a certain order of how i should get things done and this is not helping me at all.,neutral
4033,"Enjoying the app so far, but the widgets are quite limiting. You cannot use check lists in the widgets, and sometimes they update rather weirdly. I have also had UI bugs throughout, but they haven't affected me too much. Overall good, but just needs some tweaking to make it more solid. That's not to say the service is bad. Just the mobile app.",neutral

When I put the keyboard down, the send button disappeared..as a result I couldn't send my message. Theres no search for trying to find a challenge that suits you. Theres no notifications when your party is chatting. There is also no search for guilds. I just started this app and so for these are the problems I've noticed. Otherwise it is great and I hope it improves.",neutral
4037,"This app has a nice interface and a great idea, but it seems to suffer the same issue I've found of all habit trackers. I can't easily keep track of multiple daily iterations of a habit. If I want to create a habit of say drinking 5 bottles of water a day, I want to be able to check off and keep track of each bottle drunk, then get rewarded when I finish all five. Most of the habits I want to develop fall in this category. Could this be implemented in the future?",neutral

I described everything I was doing to try to do it, what I was seeing instead of the option to unsubscribe, etc. The solution suggested did not help, so I described the situation further. The next response came from a different person, who suggested a method I had already mentioned was not working for me. After I replied again, I never got another response. I just figured out what the issue was, but I couldn't do so before getting charged again. Disappointed in the customer service.",neutral
4039,"This app is great and it already helping me stay on track with some things. It's surprising how much imaginary experience points can motivate. But, I am having a bug where dailies can't be set for a given day, they just revert to all days being checked. I want this app to keep me accountable for working out on certain days, so this is a major flaw.",neutral
4040,"Edit: Uninstalled it, takes too much interest. Honestly I find it not working offline a major issue. I liked it but it is too slow and laggy not to mention the various bugs in game. Just today I was trying to add a new tag, I entered it about 5 times before I gave up and them 15 minutes later I find the tag I entered repeated 3 times, so I try to remove the other two. Also trying to organise the tasks' order, the keep going back to their original order. Sometimes when I finish a task and check it, it doesn't work. And in the habits it stops working some times and other times it checks the habit twice positive or twice negative.",neutral

There are some things I do Mon-Sat for instance, but not on Sundays. But when I set a task to not repeat on Sunday, it sets all tasks that way. Very frustrating.",neutral
4042,"This is a great app and it really helped me do my tasks but it doesn't work properly. For example when I try to move a habit so that the list is in the order I want it to be, the app glitches and the habit is sent back to the top. I know those problems are almost insignificant but it gets seriously annoying sometimes. Fix those little problems and I'll give this app the five stars it deserves.",neutral

It's not as responsive as it looks, and the design should be worked out in the app. To complete a challenge, I need to post my goal on the chat, fine.

4044,"This app is a great idea and I love all the features. However, no matter what I set the day start time to for daily tasks to reset, they keep resetting at some seemingly random point in the middle of the day despite me having it at 2AM, which is causing all of my evening tasks and some of my midday tasks to fail as I haven't done them yet. I'm not sure if the app thinks I'm in a different time zone or what but it's very irritating. If they fix that it's 5 stars for sure.",neutral
4045,"Great until last update. Love the app, its a great tool, but since the last update, I frequently get server error notifications, and the app doesn't function in any capacity (can't chat in party, dailies and habits don't refresh, etc.). rebooting my phone and reinstalling the app did not solve the issue. I'd happily give this a 5-star if this could be fixed and I could get back to my daily log-ins and updates.",neutral
4046,"I've only started using this this morning; so far I'm hoping it helps with motivating me to accomplish things. It's definitely a great idea! I kind of am wishing the was done sort of story line to follow along with, like ones you have so many days of completing so many habits you get a clue to find whatever your quest goal is, or something like that would make it more exciting... I'll update my review once I'm a week or 2 in.",neutral
4047,"Okay But I wish it had options to increase exp and stays for example when you read a book gain x intuition when you run x times you gain x stamina, etc etc and get rewards and level that way. Gives more motivation for doing those things.",neutral
4048,"Great app, I only have one complaint: The Tavern system doesn't work. I went on vacation and knew I wouldn't be able to complete my dailies or even open the app for that matter, so I entered the Tavern thinking I was safe for the couple weeks I'd be gone. I just reopened the app and it told me I had died twice, took all of my gold, two of my items, and decreased two levels. Honestly considering deleting the app now, as I had over 100 gold saved and lost a piece of rare equipment",neutral
4049,"Decent app, but would be so much better if you could set the worth of your tasks. Some tasks are simple, like 'drink more water', others like 'save $2000'. Theres nothing but a crude difficulty rating to differentiate tasks. We cam create rewards and their worth, why wouldnt we have control of the amount of points for the tasks??",neutral
4050,I love the idea of it but I am having a hard time trying to get started. As I am setting up my dailies anything that I set for weekly seemed like they are all linked together so if I change my days on one task it changes on something else. I like what it trying to do but if this isn't corrected then I will have to find another app.,neutral
4051,"it's fine to use to check off stuff and gain/lose habits and get rewarded for it, but the formatting is so ugly and it's so easy to cheat which kinda defeats the purpose of the app. like you can make yourself level 100 or give yourself 2,000 gold if you want to. plus there's a lot of bugs even though habitica has been alive since either 2015 or 2014 so that kinda says it all for how much the staff is on things.",neutral
4052,"Incredibly useful service and thanks so much for creating it. The app tends to be buggy, but nothing that couldn't easily be worked around until the last update. Since the last update drag and drop sorting of To Do (and I suspect Dailies as well) subtasks/checklists no longer works which is really frustrating. At least the website works great as always. It's just frustrating to have to run down to the computer to fix my lists.",neutral
4053,"I really like this app though I've only used it a week. I have some suggestions though, when I add a habit I'd like to add it for the week but not weekends. In Daily tasks I can + the same task more than once which is a bit like cheating, maybe add a pop up message that says ""you've already done that today"" 😊",neutral
4054,"Over the years the platform has become stagnant. I was a huge proponent of Habitica, using it for a few years and even paying for a subscription to support development; but development beyond bug fixes never happened. It's a good tool with a potent gamification component, but they've failed to continue to make it engaging and interesting—and certainly not worth paying to support.",neutral
4055,"Great concept, but there are numerous issues that I found right off the bat. The main one for me was the fact that, once you pick a subject for your journey you can never go back and change that. I mean, there are multiple journey subjects to choose from and maybe I want to focus on one aspect of my life at a time. The app treats life like a game, after all and most games allow you to start over with different settings. Starting over in THIS game requires you to uninstall the app, reinstall the app and then create a brand new account. Kind of silly and frustrating to boot. Check out the Level Life Up app instead. It has a much better platform.",neutral
4056,This is one of the better Habit tracker app Ive tried. A couple of them I deleted after a few days just because they were So Basic yet had the Audacity to charge for a Premium Service. Habitica seems to be much more realistic and actually has a more detailed U.I for setting yourself different kinds of targets/habits. But I would like to give this app 5* once they link this app to your clock and calendar apps (or build in) & add more Notification controls. Looking forwards to updates....TBC,neutral
4057,"The app is pretty good, but I wish there was a way to put weekly tasks in. I tried setting up a task that would go off weekly but I still lost health for not completing it daily. It would be nice to be able to put repeating tasks on the app that you don't do every day, but repeat on a schedule, like laundry every Sunday or something.",neutral
4058,"It's a good sentiment but it didn't really work for me. I wanted to like it but the motivation for getting stuff outweighs the motivation to actually do the things you're supposed to and unless you join a guild or any sort of group, there's no accountability. If you don't want to use it as a social app, then I can't imagine mustering up the focus and drive not to just lie.",neutral
4059,"A very interesting idea. I would give 5 stars, but there are minor bugs in the apps. I can't choose my user name, it says there are all taken. (I'm sure No one else would use it) and I cant add a daily task. It shows an error when I try to add one. ""is not the enum for frequency "" or something similar. please fix this, I really love this idea.",neutral
4060,"Please tell me how to undo an accidentally added habit, I feel like I'm cheating when I delete and re-add a whole habit because it's bugging me. Otherwise the app is a gem. 3 stars till you fix this for me. It still doesn't work, I don't want to delete a task, I want to unclick a habit, because I've accidentally clicked positive/negative and I can't undo it. Even if I click the other one to make it even, it just registers it as a separate log.",neutral
4061,"This app is fine in concept, but the ""game"" part of Habitica, arguably the reason you would use this app over other habit tracking apps, is just too boring and not that ""gamey"" to me, which doesn't keep me motivated to keep going back to the app for my habits. Concept is good, execution leaves much to be desired.",neutral
4062,"I would be happy to give the app a five star rating as I have reaped many benefits I directly relate to my usage of Habitica, but I am prevented from doing so by recent events. I can only give you a three star rating because suddenly your application no longer functions, with no warning or information as to why or how to fix it. 500 characters is not enough to relay proper data on this issue to the Dev Team, likely by design, and for that I blame Google Play, not the Dev Team of Habitica.",neutral
4063,"This app has done a good job of helping me keep track of tasks. Dailies, Habits, and the To Do with checklists have been wonderful. I just don't like the new redesign. Nothing looks to be where it should be to me. It now feels bulky and clunky, and I feel like it will make me use it a lot less because it is now uncomfortable to look at.",neutral
4064,"I love Habitica and I like the UI of the updated app, but I find it frustrating that the app doesn't show all the content that the website does. Normally this is just a small annoyance--but now, after paying for a Group plan for my family, I'm discovering that my kids can't access the group tasks list via the app! Which makes the entire thing a waste of money since the whole point was to be able to create tasks for family chores. Please tell me a fix is in the works!",neutral
4065,overall decent experience. main areas I'm not happy with are ui design choices. lots of wasted space and navigational steps that could be improved.

4068,Edit: Reverted to old version or something and issues are back :( Edit: Issue fixed and new update is great! Seems like you actually passed the issue along instead of making complaining subscriber have to repeat the complaint in email... Huge fan of Habitica. Used it for years. It was called HabitRPG when I started. Only to-do list app I have stuck to. Encourages you to build good habits in a fun way. Community-built. No ads...worth subscribing to support the app.,neutral

If you feel like you need less complexity in your life them this probably isn't for you as this adds a new system that you have to get to grips with and plus the gamification aspect can be quite destracting and finnecky.

I suggest that this should let the said task or etc to only show up on the 
date you stated, or have a tag you can activate to show it, or at least not 
turn red or damage you until the start date of your choice, or just some

4285,"I have been using this app for a while, really trying to get to grips with it but I've come to conclude that it's not me. If you feel like you need less complexity in your life them this probably isn't for you as this adds a new system that you have to get to grips with and plus the gamification aspect can be quite destracting and finnecky. I think if this were to ever be useful for me it would need a separate environment for tasks, habits and dailies.",neutral
4286,Edit: Reverted to old version or something and issues are back :( Edit: Issue fixed and new update is great! Seems like you actually passed the issue along instead of making complaining subscriber have to repeat the complaint in email... Huge fan of Habitica. Used it for years. It was called HabitRPG when I started. Only to-do list app I have stuck to. Encourages you to build good habits in a fun way. Community-built. No ads...worth subscribing to support the app.,neutral
4287,fun way to track habits. It would be great if you could update tasks without an interent connection and then just sync the next time your connected like many other trackers,neutral

Unfortunately, after level 25 the app becomes a money grab and the items you find and the equipment you can buy with coins get severely capped.

Another thing is I dont think we should be paying 3 gems to change our class.

I just reopened the app and it told me I had died twice, took all of my gold, two of my items, and decreased two levels.

I'd happily give this a 5-star if this could be fixed and I could get back to my daily log-ins and updates.",neutral
4325,would be good if it is made offline atleast for todos,neutral
4326,overall decent experience. main areas I'm not happy with are ui design choices. lots of wasted space and navigational steps that could be improved.

4327,"This app is a great idea and I love all the features. However, no matter what I set the day start time to for daily tasks to reset, they keep resetting at some seemingly random point in the middle of the day despite me having it at 2AM, which is causing all of my evening tasks and some of my midday tasks to fail as I haven't done them yet. I'm not sure if the app thinks I'm in a different time zone or what but it's very irritating. If they fix that it's 5 stars for sure.",neutral

4334,"I would be happy to give the app a five star rating as I have reaped many benefits I directly relate to my usage of Habitica, but I am prevented from doing so by recent events. I can only give you a three star rating because suddenly your application no longer functions, with no warning or information as to why or how to fix it. 500 characters is not enough to relay proper data on this issue to the Dev Team, likely by design, and for that I blame Google Play, not the Dev Team of Habitica.",neutral
4335,The app crashes very often. You also have to restart the app every time for a reward to show up in your inventory.,neutral
4336,This is one of the better Habit tracker app Ive tried. A couple of them I deleted after a few days just because they were So Basic yet had the Audacity to charge for a Premium Service. Habitica seems to be much more realistic and actually has a more detailed U.I for setting yourself different kinds of targets/habits. But I would like to give this app 5* once they link this app to your clock and calendar apps (or build in) & add more Notification controls. Looking forwards to updates....TBC,neutral
4337,Needs internet connection and is a pain to set up simole tasks.,neutral
4338,"it's fine to use to check off stuff and gain/lose habits and get rewarded for it, but the formatting is so ugly and it's so easy to cheat which kinda defeats the purpose of the app. like you can make yourself level 100 or give yourself 2,000 gold if you want to. plus there's a lot of bugs even though habitica has been alive since either 2015 or 2014 so that kinda says it all for how much the staff is on things.",neutral
4339,"I love it, compared to other apps like it. but i do miss the features that epic win has, that you can sort your to do s based on the day.. so you can set up to dos for the future, while in habits it all shows in one list instead of being separated by date",neutral
4340,Hi I like this app 😍 it could be better if the todo list's tasks were sorted by their deadline and also today's tasks had a different color!! And a reward could be a game which needs some coins to play them! Thank you!!,neutral

Once it got long enough, the words disappeared behind my keyboard so I couldn't see what I was writing. When I put the keyboard down, the send button disappeared..as a result I couldn't send my message. Theres no search for trying to find a challenge that suits you. Theres no notifications when your party is chatting. There is also no search for guilds. I just started this app and so for these are the problems I've noticed.

4347,"Great concept, but there are numerous issues that I found right off the bat. The main one for me was the fact that, once you pick a subject for your journey you can never go back and change that. I mean, there are multiple journey subjects to choose from and maybe I want to focus on one aspect of my life at a time. The app treats life like a game, after all and most games allow you to start over with different settings. Starting over in THIS game requires you to uninstall the app, reinstall the app and then create a brand new account. Kind of silly and frustrating to boot. Check out the Level Life Up app instead.

4407,"It worked fine for a while, but now every time I click on a task/habit/goal to edit, the app crashes. I can tick off the task and plus on the habit just fine, but I can't edit anything now... Please look into fixing it soon? Edit: thank you, the latest update fixed it all!",positive
4408,"So far so good, you have to be willing to set on the app for a bit to figure it out. It's a rpg game based off of truth. The app does freeze fairly frequently but you just have to close it and reopen it and everything is back in order.",positive
4409,Great app and service! The user base is amazing and the staff is awesome. No notification when a challenge ends and no way to automatically remove its associated tasks. Can't read the full text of challenge tasks before joining. The health/experience widget doesn't display any information.,positive
4410,"I like this app, and it's really helped, but now I can't open it anymore. It crashes while loading, every time. I've tried troubleshooting, restarting, deleting the cache, but nothing seems to work.",positive
4411,"There are some things i feel need to be ironed out e.g. i found feeding the pets/mounts a bit buggy, but overall it has definitely helped me think more about my personal goals and how to approach them",positive
4412,"Great app, would be nice to be able to check the checklist items in todos.",positive
4413,Great concept! Has me waking up on schedule and doing my tasks so I dont loose life and earn exp! Just one thing. I cant do quests. I got the dust bunnies quest but I have no clue what to do with it. Help?,positive
4414,"I couldn't change the language of this software, I tried it again and again, but the language didn't change.",positive
4415,"It has been an effective motivator and tracker for me to accomplish the smaller tasks that get me closer towards my bigger goals. But there seems to be a Bug - I can't seem to receive a friend's Party invite, though I am able to create my own party and invite friends to it. It's a one way street in my app! Joining guilds and the self-care, self-sabotage info have been most educational and helpful.",positive
4416,"I like the app a lot, but some features are a little annoying. I have a few suggestions. - More ways to tweak what the widgets look like (currently they take up a lot of space). - It would be nice to see the completed tasks together with active tasks instead of them disappearing. - Task subcategories! Please! 💚 - Biggest gripe: because of the way the entire list item is like a button, I keep accidentally checking tasks that weren't actually done. +Bugged unchecking. Pls fix. Thanks💚💚💚",positive
4417,"I just want to say that the tutorial was too much info, things like this should be explained in a short and concise way, at a good pace. It was just too long and too much to take in. I didn't even try the app though, I can't say what rating it deserves. I am unnistalling but I may come back to it in the future, it's not you, it's me. (Also, you can't delete your account on mobile but you can on desktop. I suggest people to try the desktop version since it may have more features)",positive
4418,"It's been a good way to get things done, and the concept of an RPG is very well executed. The reason for 4 out of 5 is simply regarding the interface. My wife uses it on iOS and it is light-years beyond what we have on Android. Much cleaner, more useful information, and less clunkiness.",positive
4419,It was amazing! I just didn't have the time to set it up all the way.,positive
4420,The ios app is lot better than this. please improve it as soon as possible.,positive
4421,"I really like the concept of this app, the style, the features, and it has done its part in motivating my studies and organizing my life. However, the app needs some serious redesigning. The layout is difficult to navigate and the chat function is almost useless. The way challenges are organized could also use improvement. All in all, I like using it (make an account a month ago), but the functionality needs to be improved",positive
4422,"This app is an awesome (and fun) to-do list! I like it a lot and it helps me out with my life and tasks every day. However, the app crashes whenever I try to sort to-dos by scheduled and it's getting a bit frustrating.",positive
4423,"So far it's pretty good. I've been using it about a week. Sometimes it doesn't refresh, but the other users on the app seem positive and friendly. There is a lot that I am learning through users that isn't actually explained in the app. Like if you don't do all your daily tasks, the whole party takes damage. So yeah, no pressure! It would be nice for a better help options or a more detailed in-app-fist-time training/learning session. Every 'first' should option for more info!",positive
4424,Could be better if it was completely free.,positive
4425,Best app for daily Routine but there are some issue such as you can get lot of coins and increase your level to infinit though settings. You should improve that because Some one donot get motivated for doing task when you knew that you can change your level.,positive
4426,It really is worth it to download this app. Thank you for designing this wonderful app! Thnks so much,positive
4427,"Have been looking for a way to incorporate the elements of gaming into making progress ""In Real Life"". Even tried inventing something for myself but paper tracking was a nightmare and having it in this app is just fantastic! Really like it and it has made a big difference! The only reason I took it down a star is because it depletes my phone battery really fast if I am in the app for very long, such as when I am shopping or browsing challenges, so I do these things mostly on my PC. Overall, great job! Would recommend this to anyone that enjoys gaming but is struggling with motivation in the real world.",positive
4428,"Great idea and I'm enjoying it so far. Chores and errands are much more fun. My one gripe so far is that it seems like most items/quests cost gems, which are pay to play. I'm afraid i'll pretty quickly run out of free items/quests to strive for and then the app will lose its effectiveness. It'd be helpful if their were other ways to unlock gems outside of paying for them, like reaching extra high levels of productivity/habit building, etc.",positive
4429,This app is awesome could use better graphics but overall the idea of it is legit af,positive
4430,"I've been using this app for about a year now, I think. I love keeping myself accountable, and tracking what I'm doing and what I'm not each day. Lately, I've been getting push notifications for every single message that members of my party are sending in chat, none of which mention me. I've switched off push notifications completely but they're still coming through all the time. This is the only thing stopping me from giving 5 stars!",positive
4431,"This app has really helped me get my stuff in order! It also has an active community and good challenges! It is a bit glitchy at times (things don't refresh, etc) but overall it's great! Edit: lol, the 'report a bug' is glitched on my phone :P I had to manually send my info over, in the middle of fixing a glitch where my day won't reset - been broken for a week.",positive
4432,"I'm easily motivated by things like points and streaks, so this app works really well for me to increase my productivity and decrease my anxiety. I use rewards for breaks, and find that I get unpleasant but short tasks done much more often, because I can earn breaks quickly by just getting them over with. I also get my long, complicated, multi-part projects done early. I gave it four stars because there are a couple of features I'd like to see, but it works great as is.",positive
4433,"This is a very helpful and fun way to get yourself in the habit of doing things. The Daily Tasks are a fantastic way to get your daily stuff handled and check them off within the app. You've got the ability to create To-Do lists with due dates and notification reminders can make it ridiculously simple to get even the most complex task completed. On top of all this, seeing your character earn experience, new items and getting pets and mounts turns all the monotony into a wickedly AWESOME RPG.",positive
4434,"I'm surprised, this app actually works for me! It helped me procrastinate less, but I also realised it works only if I remind myself to check the app a lot. I recommend it for those who have really bad procrastination problems like myself. Even if the game style of this app isn't your thing, it's a great to-do-list app for habits, daily reminders and general to-do items. Only complaint is it's glitchy for me when I want to customise my avatar.",positive
4435,"Not very expressive frame for activity descriptions, must be in the first stages of development. Guilds look incredible diverse, very surprising it is a social app. Seems the leveling function is standard gaming and well embedded. Hope open sourcing it make it better fit. Passing habits to to-do would be desirable.",positive
4436,"I've been wanting a habit tracker that is fun and this definitely is. There are a few loading issues every so often, if those bugs weren't there I'd give 5 stars. All around though enjoyable, easy to use, and a great way to keep track of good and bad habits.",positive
4437,"Amazing app. Some glitchy moments, but overall nothing too annoying. This app is so cool that I'm OK with some glitches because in a very short time its already brought so much value to my life! Brilliant idea to get you into good habits and out of bad ones. In my experience it actually works!",positive
4438,"Fun for university students The only problem is they don't order the tasks by date, do you have to be careful not to miss homework. Now that i think about it, it's actually a big problem for students using the app. It is fun, overall, and I do homework to keep my avatars alive. Think Tamagotchi",positive
4439,"Every other month, I think I'll do better. I try again. I download this app. Everything gets back in order, so I uninstall it to free up space in my storage. Then I relapse. I download the app again. This is a never ending cycle of desperation, loss, and hope. I will always download this app. I will always uninstall it. 9/10 would recommend",positive
4440,This app is good and it's useful. Yes it's true that it has a few bugs here and there but the app itself is good and I like it. I wish it had an offline mode because I can't stay on all the time but I can see why we need to be online at all times.,positive
4441,"I love this format, only thing that would make it better is some form of active side scrolling gameplay element, build your character throughout the week and then try to beat a level sort of thing",positive
4442,"A great idea, and the app itself has been improved a fair bit, but still a little bit too slow to respond to give five stars. Seems a bit like server congestion maybe?",positive
4443,Pretty good app that helps me stay organized. Could use a few improvements but overall I enjoy it,positive
4444,"Really nice app that is easy to use. Would be cool to see a feature where you can build things, like building a village and materials for this are acquired through completing tasks/habits",positive
4445,"couldn't create my avatar at first, but after that it worked fine.",positive
4446,Habitica is awesome! Only thing that it's hard to feed your pets with the app.,positive
4447,"Love habitica. I find the app often has one bug or another from update to update, so can't really give 5 stars, but the devs do a smashing job regardless so 4 stars from me.",positive
4448,"Can this please get a feature where I can add tasks when offline and it uploads to the server whenever I connect to the internet. At the moment, it simply deletes everything.",positive
4449,Its pretty good so far. My dailies just seem to never reset though. I got a streak of 2 and from then on it never moved forward,positive
4450,Fabulous tool for task management by those organizationally challenged. For five stars it would need to include a calendar function.,positive
4451,The app is good and all. The only problem is that the reminder does not work.,positive
4452,"I have been using Habitica for quite some time now and i must say, it has been the most useful in helping me establish a structure to my day. HOWEVER, the To-Dos are very limited in its functions. It's hard to implement a full task management (such as GTD methodology). It pretty much only supports next action steps, not any layers such as Projects or Waiting For. Also, syncing across devices can sometimes be problematic I hope they will improve the To-Dos and make syncing smoother.",positive
4453,"I've been using this app since the beginning of December and it has really helped me with keeping on track with tasks and developing habits. However, there are a few issues with the party features. When a message is sent in the chat, no one is notified and we cannot respond appropriately unless we actively check. The chat and members tab also tends to not load up and I have to leave the app in order for it to work again. Navigating the app is also quite a hassle but it isn't a major issue.",positive
4454,"The app's a bit glitch-y, not gonna lie, but it helps tremendously in my day-to-day life. The community aspect of it is amazing, I actually feel motivated by all the kind words. Good job, developers, my life's a bit less bleak now! c:",positive
4455,"The app is a great concept helping me keep track of goals and be motivated to do the things I need to in a day. Friendly competition and cooperation keep things interesting and encouraging. Quests are wonderful long term motivation, along with the goal of filling the stable. It is discouraging, frustrating and hurtful when I try to check off dailies (or do ANYTHING on the app) and it doesn't let me because of connection failures. I lost health overnight because it didn't let me check off my dailies? Especially frustrating during quests. Myself and friends all have the ""connection problems"" in different locations on data, or wifi at the same time... Fixes are quick, and interactions/responses pleasant! Great app!",positive
4456,"Guys - I really want to like this app more and give it 5 stars! Everything is there and I can see the work and effort that has gone into making it so thank you so much! But on Android the habits screen is quite buggy and won't let me adjust the streaks. The keyboard comes up but closes immediately so I can't do anything. The dailies work fine. I look forward to any updates you're planning but considering this is free, I think what you've achieved is great!",positive
4457,"A really great idea with a lot of great features! I love it a lot. However, it's a bit unresponsive at times. Actions that previously worked will occasionally not go through for mystery reasons . And the widgets, while displaying correctly, have bad interactivity. Thats said, the art is cute, the features are helpful and extensive, and the positive impact it has on my habits is amazing",positive
4458,"I would have reported this as a bug within the app, but I found another bug when trying to do that. First one: when submitting a bug or feedback, it does not pass through the 'To' address into the email, so I'm not sure where to send it to. Second one: when editing a habit, daily or to-do text field, the keyboard pops up and disappears. A workaround on this (for my device) is to rotate the phone landscape. Using pixel 3. Otherwise, a very good app!",positive
4459,Great concept. Reminders do not work and from some quick research it appears this has been an issue for literal years now. I was really hoping I could have the app remind me of tasks instead of setting a hundred alarms on my phone. I'd prefer not to have both. I'd really appreciate if reminders would actually work.,positive
4460,"A little buggy sometimes but all is forgiven for how much this app helps me be a more productive and motivated person. I have one request, please add some sort of real life stat tracker. The idea would be to assign tasks, habits, or dailies to certain skill categories and you could track points, levels, or hours for certain skills. For example, this would be cool for me to keep track of my progress towards mastery as a woodworker or painter etc.",positive
4461,"The idea is good, but the app can be made better with some performance optimisation. For example, when I launch the app, it takes at least 3 seconds to synchronize and restart my habit list with the correct status. And all pop-ups only appear with a 2sec delay. Overall I like the idea, by I'm moving onto other habit tracker apps because this kind of gamification isn't for me :) Appreciate the app.",positive
4462,"Pretty great app, motivates me to do stuff I normally wouldn't want to because of the prospect of leveling up. One small gripe I have is that if something with a reminder is marked complete before the reminder goes off, it still reminds you even though you've already done it. Also, sounds when you mark something, etc come out the Ringtone channel, not the Media channel.",positive
4463,"love the idea! but the execution is kind of clumsy. there's little to no guidance with regard to how parties or challenges work, and the rewards seem to be random at best. the graphics are adorable and the app definitely has potential though! but it would be more user friendly to streamline the app because it can be overwhelming with so many choices and options (i.e. mounts, food, eggs, etc) that seem mostly arbitrary.",positive
4464,"This app has been so helpful for me to be more productive, as i didnt take care kf myself before! i can't complain about anything, except sometimes when i first log in for the day, my dailies will be from yesterday and will take a minute to switch to today. I would love to see why so-and-so points are being deducted when you take damage from missed dailies! Like.... ""Clean (medium): -6 Health"" or something like that. I don't think I'll ever delete this app, and i look forward to any updates!",positive
4465,"I'm just starting out with Habitica and am liking it so far, but the To-Dos would be much more useful if they could be organized by due date. I've got like 25 things on that list, with due dates over the next two weeks or so, and it would be much easier to actually accomplish these things if I could easily see which were the most urgent instead of having to scroll up and down and compare dates in a mental tally.",positive
4466,"I really love this app! It makes me more motivated in doing my tasks. But, the only problem is, after a week while using this app the pop up message ""Connection Error"" began showing up on my screen. I'm connected in our wifi and it's fast enough. If it's just because the app is ""under maintenance"", I would appreciate if you will put a message regarding on that like ""Under Maintenance: Go back for an hour"". It's working now! ^v^",positive
4467,"Great app, stability is still a bit shakey but you never lose anything even if there is a crash. Join this community if you are serious about getting your act together and having as much fun as you can while doing it. You get what you put into this and you don't have to pay a penny if you don't want to. But in my experience, when you meet the amazing people this place attracts, you'll find yourself getting more and more involved and wanting to contribute however you can.",positive
4468,"I LOVE habitica, however I m think the app misses a lot of functionality when compared with website. For example the challenges in a guild is not displayed and the task detail in challenges are also not displayed. I mainly used the web version, but it would be great if there are not much differences between the website and this app!",positive
4469,"Very nice app for productivity. My favorite feature is that tasks and dailies that are finished can he hidden. However, it requires connection too much. Wouldn't mind syncing from time to time but I'd really hope there could be a way to tick off tasks even offline. Also would love to see ""weeklies"" or something that doesn't reset everyday for goals like ""go to gym 3x this week"" or ""walk dogs 5x this week"". Integration of calendar events would also be nice.",positive
4470,"I only started using it yesterday, and so far it is interesting, and I think it will be useful. I'd give it 4.5 stars, but that isn't an option, so 4 it is, for now. I'd really like to see a better way to organize Dailies, preferably alphabetically, so tasks I tag as Morning will show up before Night (though admittedly, that wouldn't help if I labeled any 'Afternoon' or 'Noon').",positive
4471,"A fun way to get into habits. Makes me want to do things in real life as I find it very rewarding. I think it would be helpful if there was a timestamp on the dailies/habits as to when you last checked the item off. I don't have the best memory and feel like some days I double up on certain tasks because I can't remember if I've checked it off or not alredy 😅 I would like to see how long it has been since I last did a task, again, I often forget. Other than that it's fantastic!",positive
4472,"Cool app, but I wish I could see everything I own at once. When I get a new item, I have to search every inventory screen to figure out where is went. Confusing for new players. Also, if you don't have a party, it's basically a checklist since all the gane modes are forced multiplayer.",positive
4473,I wish I could control the reminders for my tasks more. Like the volume or what noise it makes. Other that that the app is great for keeping track of things that need to be done.,positive
4474,Amazing application. Gamifying basic tasks really motivates me to complete them. Also naturally teaches about goal structuring. Comparatively not as good as the browser based version. Simple things like an in-app pop up for completing a quest haven't been transcribed over. Looking forward to that optimization! Thanks for the great tool.,positive
4475,"Really enjoy the app, probably wouldnt recommend unless you have someone to do it with. Also, please set up a system of 'weekly' tasks, currently you can only set a daily that you complete once a week but it would be nice to have the flexibility of doing a task any day that week without being penalised.",positive
4476,"I love this app alot. theres just two things I would really love to see added. it would be great if you allowed us to choose to have a habit set up for like 3 times out of the week, without picking which days of the week. I also really wish I could have more than 4 habits, is there a way to do that? it's a great app, thanks so much",positive
4477,"CAN YOU PLEASE ADD THE ABILITY TO HEAR A SAMPLE OF THE AUDIO THEMES BEFORE YOU SELECT THEM? I tried another popular RPG checklist app and I didnt like it as much. This app for me has been life-changing, literally. Its a great app for breaking bad habits, building up good habits or having a videogame style quest checklist that gives you instant gratification for completing real-world tasks. Theres some occasional glitches but nothing major, they can be fixed by closing the app and restarting it.",positive
4478,"I guess I love it as it kind of works? I mean this is as good as an app can get for it's purpose. It has the perfect amount of features and completely customizable. The biggest problem I have is at the beginning it's very challenging to keep alive (as you have no party/armour yet) and also as far as I'm aware I could only edit the order of the dailies, I wish they can be done to other sectors too.",positive
4479,"clever stuff. great concept that is already working on me, especially like the widgets, they made it really functional. Only 4 star as the walkthrough wasnt close toenough to get to grips with the game fully, i still dont actually know why my health resets or how to increase health dispite adding healthy eating and exercise. it seems like there is some mechanic somewhere to battle with your guy, but not explained anywhere, adding in some kind of quests or mini-game would be the icing on the cake",positive
4480,"This has been really engaging in my tasks and goals and I am just at day two of using it. For the app, it would be cool if there was a notification for any chat threads users are on so if anybody had a follow-up question, I would be able to return to the inquiry and add more to the discussion if needed.",positive
4481,"I used this all the time before, and it was fun in the beginning, but got really tired of the low res graphics! If they were a bit more high def, it would be amazing! we could finally see the equipment customization better - more motivating to continue using and complete tasks.",positive
4482,"Make it easier to understand when you're activating quests. I didn't have anyone in my party by I was still somehow doing it and finished it by myself without realizing it. Make a design change/renaming so that there's something labeled ""start quest"". Still a fun and useful app. Growth is neverending",positive
4483,"I like it a lot. But it doesn't have as much of the GAME aspect to it. I wish there was a feature where you character could actually play in an rpg game using the equipment and skills you earned. You could have a little rpg game on the side and has cute little morality stories. Without it, it doesn't really incentivize much.",positive
4484,since the May 1st update it made me create my character 15+ times before I uninstalled and reinstalled before having to do it again and spending close to 45 minutes deleting pre generated habits dailies and to dos to get to my original ones. Terrible. I love the app otherwise. Update: since the new update it is fixed.,positive
4485,"Health widget stopped working after latest Android update. Note 8. AT&T. Interesting take on habit forming. I'm not really a gamer but I like the point system, leveling up, and buying accessories for your avatar with those points. Nerdy fun that seems to actually be motivating me in a way other habit trackers haven't been able to. (The TED talk on the inspiration for this app is really interesting too.)",positive
4486,"Just downloaded the app.Loving the idea of adding my own habits & to do stuff which i used to tick off daily on notepad(uff) ,now I am glad its automated with rewards too!!.(yay!)Have a suggestion to make all sections of list tabs movable up/down (like the rewards section) to organise as per customisable preference.(-:)",positive
4487,It's super helpful but why do all the multiplayer functions suck or not exist on mobile? Edit: I'd really like to do the missions and stuff but I'm not really in this for friends. I'd like a way to find a group on mobile. Maybe a random matchup option?,positive
4488,"This productivity app is amazing for anyone looking to gamify their life. I've been using this for about half a year and it's made a difference in motivating me to be productive. The app can act up sometimes however, with it syncing my activities properly, but other than that, this app is great!",positive
4489,"Just started using the app and it doesn't scale with my phone's zoom settings so the icons on the bottom are cut off. Is there a way to fix this? It doesn't seem to have its own zoom options. More accessibility features would be great (e.g. zoom, contrast, dexterity settings). Also it's great to see a wheelchair available for the avatar but it would be more inclusive and fun for more users if there were more types of default assistive devices (canes, walkers, crutches, braces, glasses, etc).",positive
4490,"The only issue I keep finding is that I get constant errors ""disconnected from servers"" even if I have full Wifi or full 4g connection. It gets clunky with the network connectivity. HOWEVER, it has changed my productivity radically in these dark days of my life.",positive
4491,"Easiest way for me to use Habitica. Simple but motivating. I'm not sure if moving the plus button to the center was a good idea, it covers more of the text of the tasks there. Though it is a easy to forget that you need to pull down on the tasks section to see any changes in inventory/tables.",positive
4492,"Perfect app!.... but its missing an IMPORTANT tab... its already got Habits, Dailies and To-Do's BUT it doesn't have a Bucket List/Life Goals tab, for me, It doesn't feel right to put ""Learn a new recipe"" in the To-do Tab, I also want to put in my goals like ""focus on getting high grades"" or ""get a girlfriend"", I can't put these in other tabs",positive
4493,"Is a very unique to-do list which keeps you complete all task. The only problem I found with this app, is that sometimes is very buggy. You cannot use this app offline, and you cannot sync your calendar with this. Overall is very recommended. Is like a game",positive
4494,"I love everything about this app except for the fact that there isn't a calendar to put in to do's that have to be done on specific days. If they added a calendar, this would be a million star app. I LOVE everything else about it.",positive
4495,"We are using this as a group in my family and it honestly is helping us a lot with staying motivated. I have a difficult time with my anxiety and depression, but this app has helped me to feel a sense of accomplishment. I am experiencing inspiration a little more often and I have been struggling for years with this. There are some aspects I'm not entirely fond of that I hope will continue to be updated; however I'm grateful to the developers for making and keeping up with this!",positive
4496,"The app version has so much more to improve. Aside from being buggy, a lot of features are still missing compared tovthe web version. Four stars because it helps me nonetheless. I wish the team best of luck and thank you for Habitica! ✨",positive
4497,love it just wish I could have pixel icons for all tasks and rewards. either uploading my own or if you could design things like pixelated toothbrushes. cute icons and a fun as well as organized visual aspect will help me to be in the app more and getting it set up as it has been a slow project I'm working on.,positive
4498,Pretty good but it'd be better of there was some kind of mini game option where your avatar does stuff like fighting or studying along with you. I dunno it'd just be fun to have that extra interaction and to give meaning to the points system.,positive
4499,"Excellent app, great habit tracker. I've found in this app an exciting way to be productive! There are some bugs and functionalities that need to be fixed, however, it's worth using it. I really recommend it.",positive
4500,"awesome app, love the prize feature. i would give 5 stars if these two issues were solved: 1. app does not notify me about dailies even though i set a reminder for 7:45am; 2. one of my hobbies that can be checked as both positive and negative stays green forever after checking once, does not refresh at night, is that how its supposed to be?",positive
4501,It really is worth it to download this app. Thank you for designing this wonderful app! Thnks so much,positive
4502,"The game is pretty fun, but it's really frustrating to pay 100 coins for an enchanted armoire chest and only get experience or food. It's honestly beginning to ruin the game for me. If it doesn't change in about a month I'm rewriting this review to leave a lower score.",positive
4503,It was amazing! I just didn't have the time to set it up all the way.,positive
4504,"Habitica is the best productivity app I've used thus far. It lasted me for months. The quests are the most motivating feature, and I was able to take down a couple bosses solo. However, motivation dried up weeks into my first fetch quest because despite being extremely productive, I had no chance of finding even one shard. Unless you're comfortable teaming up with a bunch of strangers to take on quests, there becomes a point when being solo makes the quest motivation feature impossible.",positive
4505,"Сам сервис очень крутой, но пожалуйста сделайте более понятный интерфейс для «Habits», пусть они они становятся серыми или изчезают, когда человек отметил свой прогресс за день. Я банально не помню, отмечала я свой прогресс сегодня или ещё нет, а показатель в виде цифры или зелёного/рыжего цвета мне ни о чем не говорит.",positive
4506,Great concept! Has me waking up on schedule and doing my tasks so I dont loose life and earn exp! Just one thing. I cant do quests. I got the dust bunnies quest but I have no clue what to do with it. Help?,positive
4507,This app is awesome could use better graphics but overall the idea of it is legit af,positive
4508,"Great app! I would like more progression content. Resetting levels is easy implementation, but gets stale quickly. Mages do too much damage. But this app had been transformative and amazing. I will consider contributing to development.",positive
4509,"Great app, would be nice to be able to check the checklist items in todos.",positive
4510,This is wonderful but I really need to be able to use it offline as well,positive
4511,"I couldn't change the language of this software, I tried it again and again, but the language didn't change.",positive
4512,Great app and service! The user base is amazing and the staff is awesome. No notification when a challenge ends and no way to automatically remove its associated tasks. Can't read the full text of challenge tasks before joining. The health/experience widget doesn't display any information.,positive
4513,"I love this game. It has helped me do much It's a bit of a learning curve. It would be nice if challenges were visible from the app in all of the guilds, and I would also like to see the last day and time that a habit was marked, because the colors don't always change and if you have a lot of habits it gets confusing. Otherwise, this app is brilliantly done and will be getting my monetary support in whatever way I can afford.",positive
4514,Good,positive
4515,"Pretty cool, but it needs a diary that keeps full logs of your activities and performance. It's pro reliable but it's important to know sometimes the service goes down and doesn't work. It's pretty rare though.",positive
4516,"lol i went to settings, change character value, and got myself 9M coins uwu btw is that cheating...? I mean well its right there",positive
4517,"It worked fine for a while, but now every time I click on a task/habit/goal to edit, the app crashes. I can tick off the task and plus on the habit just fine, but I can't edit anything now... Please look into fixing it soon? Edit: thank you, the latest update fixed it all!",positive
4518,Great for ADHD,positive
4519,"I've tried quite a few rpg-like to-do list apps and I must say this one is the only one that I find genuinely enjoyable, and actually kinda feels like a game. You can tell a lot of effort was put into the aesthetic, everything is very easy to access and is pleasing to the eye. Although I think there should be a way to uncheck to-do's. I keep accidentally clicking on them in the widget and remaking them every time is starting to get annoying.",positive
4520,Could be better if it was completely free.,positive
4521,"So far so good, you have to be willing to set on the app for a bit to figure it out. It's a rpg game based off of truth. The app does freeze fairly frequently but you just have to close it and reopen it and everything is back in order.",positive
4522,"I like this app, and it's really helped, but now I can't open it anymore. It crashes while loading, every time. I've tried troubleshooting, restarting, deleting the cache, but nothing seems to work.",positive
4523,"Thank you. I love the app and it's helping me immensely already. The only suggestion I can think of is, I wish there was a way of keeping track of my previously completed tasks so I could look back on the progress I've made. It would feel much more meaningful that way and serve as additional motivation.",positive
4524,"There are some things i feel need to be ironed out e.g. i found feeding the pets/mounts a bit buggy, but overall it has definitely helped me think more about my personal goals and how to approach them",positive
4525,"It has been an effective motivator and tracker for me to accomplish the smaller tasks that get me closer towards my bigger goals. But there seems to be a Bug - I can't seem to receive a friend's Party invite, though I am able to create my own party and invite friends to it. It's a one way street in my app! Joining guilds and the self-care, self-sabotage info have been most educational and helpful.",positive
4526,The ios app is lot better than this. please improve it as soon as possible.,positive
4527,Best app for daily Routine but there are some issue such as you can get lot of coins and increase your level to infinit though settings. You should improve that because Some one donot get motivated for doing task when you knew that you can change your level.,positive
4528,"I like the app a lot, but some features are a little annoying. I have a few suggestions. - More ways to tweak what the widgets look like (currently they take up a lot of space). - It would be nice to see the completed tasks together with active tasks instead of them disappearing. - Task subcategories! Please! 💚 - Biggest gripe: because of the way the entire list item is like a button, I keep accidentally checking tasks that weren't actually done. +Bugged unchecking. Pls fix. Thanks💚💚💚",positive
4529,"I just want to say that the tutorial was too much info, things like this should be explained in a short and concise way, at a good pace. It was just too long and too much to take in. I didn't even try the app though, I can't say what rating it deserves. I am unnistalling but I may come back to it in the future, it's not you, it's me. (Also, you can't delete your account on mobile but you can on desktop. I suggest people to try the desktop version since it may have more features)",positive
4530,"It's been a good way to get things done, and the concept of an RPG is very well executed. The reason for 4 out of 5 is simply regarding the interface. My wife uses it on iOS and it is light-years beyond what we have on Android. Much cleaner, more useful information, and less clunkiness.",positive
4531,"This app is an awesome (and fun) to-do list! I like it a lot and it helps me out with my life and tasks every day. However, the app crashes whenever I try to sort to-dos by scheduled and it's getting a bit frustrating.",positive
4532,Pretty good app that helps me stay organized. Could use a few improvements but overall I enjoy it,positive
4533,Habitica is awesome! Only thing that it's hard to feed your pets with the app.,positive
4534,"couldn't create my avatar at first, but after that it worked fine.",positive
4535,"Love habitica. I find the app often has one bug or another from update to update, so can't really give 5 stars, but the devs do a smashing job regardless so 4 stars from me.",positive
4536,"Great idea and I'm enjoying it so far. Chores and errands are much more fun. My one gripe so far is that it seems like most items/quests cost gems, which are pay to play. I'm afraid i'll pretty quickly run out of free items/quests to strive for and then the app will lose its effectiveness. It'd be helpful if their were other ways to unlock gems outside of paying for them, like reaching extra high levels of productivity/habit building, etc.",positive
4537,"So far it's pretty good. I've been using it about a week. Sometimes it doesn't refresh, but the other users on the app seem positive and friendly. There is a lot that I am learning through users that isn't actually explained in the app. Like if you don't do all your daily tasks, the whole party takes damage. So yeah, no pressure! It would be nice for a better help options or a more detailed in-app-fist-time training/learning session. Every 'first' should option for more info!",positive
4538,"Really nice app that is easy to use. Would be cool to see a feature where you can build things, like building a village and materials for this are acquired through completing tasks/habits",positive
4539,"The app's a bit glitch-y, not gonna lie, but it helps tremendously in my day-to-day life. The community aspect of it is amazing, I actually feel motivated by all the kind words. Good job, developers, my life's a bit less bleak now! c:",positive
4540,Its pretty good so far. My dailies just seem to never reset though. I got a streak of 2 and from then on it never moved forward,positive
4541,This app is good and it's useful. Yes it's true that it has a few bugs here and there but the app itself is good and I like it. I wish it had an offline mode because I can't stay on all the time but I can see why we need to be online at all times.,positive
4542,"This app has really helped me get my stuff in order! It also has an active community and good challenges! It is a bit glitchy at times (things don't refresh, etc) but overall it's great! Edit: lol, the 'report a bug' is glitched on my phone :P I had to manually send my info over, in the middle of fixing a glitch where my day won't reset - been broken for a week.",positive
4543,"Not very expressive frame for activity descriptions, must be in the first stages of development. Guilds look incredible diverse, very surprising it is a social app. Seems the leveling function is standard gaming and well embedded. Hope open sourcing it make it better fit. Passing habits to to-do would be desirable.",positive
4544,"I'm easily motivated by things like points and streaks, so this app works really well for me to increase my productivity and decrease my anxiety. I use rewards for breaks, and find that I get unpleasant but short tasks done much more often, because I can earn breaks quickly by just getting them over with. I also get my long, complicated, multi-part projects done early. I gave it four stars because there are a couple of features I'd like to see, but it works great as is.",positive
4545,"I'm surprised, this app actually works for me! It helped me procrastinate less, but I also realised it works only if I remind myself to check the app a lot. I recommend it for those who have really bad procrastination problems like myself. Even if the game style of this app isn't your thing, it's a great to-do-list app for habits, daily reminders and general to-do items. Only complaint is it's glitchy for me when I want to customise my avatar.",positive
4546,"I've been wanting a habit tracker that is fun and this definitely is. There are a few loading issues every so often, if those bugs weren't there I'd give 5 stars. All around though enjoyable, easy to use, and a great way to keep track of good and bad habits.",positive
4547,"I really like the concept of this app, the style, the features, and it has done its part in motivating my studies and organizing my life. However, the app needs some serious redesigning. The layout is difficult to navigate and the chat function is almost useless. The way challenges are organized could also use improvement. All in all, I like using it (make an account a month ago), but the functionality needs to be improved",positive
4548,"would love, love, LOVE an offline mode as I don't have internet access at all time but adore this app to keep me on top of my life and mental and physical health",positive
4549,"Can this please get a feature where I can add tasks when offline and it uploads to the server whenever I connect to the internet. At the moment, it simply deletes everything.",positive
4550,"I love this format, only thing that would make it better is some form of active side scrolling gameplay element, build your character throughout the week and then try to beat a level sort of thing",positive
4551,"This is a very helpful and fun way to get yourself in the habit of doing things. The Daily Tasks are a fantastic way to get your daily stuff handled and check them off within the app. You've got the ability to create To-Do lists with due dates and notification reminders can make it ridiculously simple to get even the most complex task completed. On top of all this, seeing your character earn experience, new items and getting pets and mounts turns all the monotony into a wickedly AWESOME RPG.",positive
4552,"A great idea, and the app itself has been improved a fair bit, but still a little bit too slow to respond to give five stars. Seems a bit like server congestion maybe?",positive
4553,Very cool app!,positive
4554,"I've been using this app for about a year now, I think. I love keeping myself accountable, and tracking what I'm doing and what I'm not each day. Lately, I've been getting push notifications for every single message that members of my party are sending in chat, none of which mention me. I've switched off push notifications completely but they're still coming through all the time. This is the only thing stopping me from giving 5 stars!",positive
4555,The app is good and all. The only problem is that the reminder does not work.,positive
4556,"Fun for university students The only problem is they don't order the tasks by date, do you have to be careful not to miss homework. Now that i think about it, it's actually a big problem for students using the app. It is fun, overall, and I do homework to keep my avatars alive. Think Tamagotchi",positive
4557,So far I love it,positive
4558,"Amazing app. Some glitchy moments, but overall nothing too annoying. This app is so cool that I'm OK with some glitches because in a very short time its already brought so much value to my life! Brilliant idea to get you into good habits and out of bad ones. In my experience it actually works!",positive
4559,Fabulous tool for task management by those organizationally challenged. For five stars it would need to include a calendar function.,positive
4560,"Have been looking for a way to incorporate the elements of gaming into making progress ""In Real Life"". Even tried inventing something for myself but paper tracking was a nightmare and having it in this app is just fantastic! Really like it and it has made a big difference! The only reason I took it down a star is because it depletes my phone battery really fast if I am in the app for very long, such as when I am shopping or browsing challenges, so I do these things mostly on my PC. Overall, great job! Would recommend this to anyone that enjoys gaming but is struggling with motivation in the real world.",positive
4561,I wish I could control the reminders for my tasks more. Like the volume or what noise it makes. Other that that the app is great for keeping track of things that need to be done.,positive
4562,"Every other month, I think I'll do better. I try again. I download this app. Everything gets back in order, so I uninstall it to free up space in my storage. Then I relapse. I download the app again. This is a never ending cycle of desperation, loss, and hope. I will always download this app. I will always uninstall it. 9/10 would recommend",positive
4563,"Разработчик исправил ошибку, которая не давала начать и оказалось, что приложение довольно хорошее, но:Режим испытания - бред. Кто-то его использует по фану и исход решает рандом. Кто-то пиарит свой ютуб канал.Так же, нет приоритизации сложности целей.Т.е кто -то поставит сложной целью написать диплом, а кто -то сходить в магазин.Дорого,в игровой валюте, стоят квесты. За неделю так и не получил. Хотя целей было много. Удалил его, так как мне не подходит дизайн для офиса. Но это уже особенность",positive
4564,"I have been using Habitica for quite some time now and i must say, it has been the most useful in helping me establish a structure to my day. HOWEVER, the To-Dos are very limited in its functions. It's hard to implement a full task management (such as GTD methodology). It pretty much only supports next action steps, not any layers such as Projects or Waiting For. Also, syncing across devices can sometimes be problematic I hope they will improve the To-Dos and make syncing smoother.",positive
4565,Such a cool app! I'm in love with it! Sad that it doesn't work properly offline though :( also has bugs,positive
4566,Quite good,positive
4567,"It's a great start to improving your life, but it's more or less just a planner app!",positive
4568,Amazing app but the extremely buggy ui have made the app irritating to use and sometime unusable without a restart.,positive
4569,"I like it a lot. But it doesn't have as much of the GAME aspect to it. I wish there was a feature where you character could actually play in an rpg game using the equipment and skills you earned. You could have a little rpg game on the side and has cute little morality stories. Without it, it doesn't really incentivize much.",positive
4570,"It's amazing, I just wish there was goals and categories for tasks",positive
4571,"A great app for tracking goals and habits. It is also the most fun since you achieve virtual goals ""XP and Gold"" to level up your character! Will give 5/5 if it had a Dark Theme!",positive
4572,Quite confusing,positive
4573,Nice but why does it need data tho?,positive
4574,its ok little confusing at first i think some more of the features that are in the add a blah should be a bit more clear. also a report a bug option would be nice my entire phone is on silent cause im at work app still makes sounds.,positive
4575,This app can save your life. Love how you can pin widgets to your home screen on Android phones. Only suggestion is to add a calendar.,positive
4576,Great way to manage your tasks. Only downside is you set the deadlines and can knowingly chance them at any time,positive
4577,"INCREDIBLE for keeping motivation up, but the mobile app is intermittently buggy in odd ways. Definitely still highly recommend it, though!",positive
4578,Great app!,positive
4579,The concept is absolutely amaizing😊 but the procedures are very complex...😅 Can you plaese make another app with same concept👍 and with simple procedures...😊 [In simple words... Please make a simple app which has concept of gaming type rewards on completing important tasks...🤗],positive
4580,"Been using the app for half a year now, it ha helped me focus on my dailies and Tasks and organize myself and replace my bad habits with good ones",positive
4581,"Perfect app!.... but its missing an IMPORTANT tab... its already got Habits, Dailies and To-Do's BUT it doesn't have a Bucket List/Life Goals tab, for me, It doesn't feel right to put ""Learn a new recipe"" in the To-do Tab, I also want to put in my goals like ""focus on getting high grades"" or ""get a girlfriend"", I can't put these in other tabs",positive
4582,Buggy but awesome!,positive
4583,would be perfect if I could organize the to-do's by date!! they're random right now,positive
4584,"Very Nwice Hi, How can I sort my todos according to due date? Is there any way I can team up with local players? Also is any offline version coming up, just to check off tasks? Thanks.",positive
4585,"I used this all the time before, and it was fun in the beginning, but got really tired of the low res graphics! If they were a bit more high def, it would be amazing! we could finally see the equipment customization better - more motivating to continue using and complete tasks.",positive
4586,I'll give it a 5/5 once yall make it functional offline 😛 (like maybe allow us to edit/cross off tasks offline and let it automatically sync once connected to the internet),positive
4587,"Good app with good widgets one star deducted as I can't work out how to view completed tasks, dailies and habits",positive
4588,"I guess I love it as it kind of works? I mean this is as good as an app can get for it's purpose. It has the perfect amount of features and completely customizable. The biggest problem I have is at the beginning it's very challenging to keep alive (as you have no party/armour yet) and also as far as I'm aware I could only edit the order of the dailies, I wish they can be done to other sectors too.",positive
4589,Great app. I just wish there was a way to keep track of time on a task/habbit (built-in timer instead of having to open an external timer),positive
4590,"This app has been so helpful for me to be more productive, as i didnt take care kf myself before! i can't complain about anything, except sometimes when i first log in for the day, my dailies will be from yesterday and will take a minute to switch to today. I would love to see why so-and-so points are being deducted when you take damage from missed dailies! Like.... ""Clean (medium): -6 Health"" or something like that. I don't think I'll ever delete this app, and i look forward to any updates!",positive
4591,"it is fun. every time i get an egg/food/potion though, i have to drag down the spinning wheel to let it reload 😒",positive
4592,"The app version has so much more to improve. Aside from being buggy, a lot of features are still missing compared tovthe web version. Four stars because it helps me nonetheless. I wish the team best of luck and thank you for Habitica! ✨",positive
4593,"just started using and seems interesting, hope it'll help me to improve my life! one issue I have is that it does not give an option to sort to-do task by deadlines, which is better to see which tasks are urgent and not overlooked, hope there's an update to add this function!",positive
4594,"rlly good,just 4 for bugs.. but it's really good!!",positive
4595,"i cannot pin/unpin rewards after UI updated, plz fix it. i love this game😭",positive
4596,"with the new update, when you tap tasks or the eggs and hatching potions you have to close and reopen the app in order to get it to load. but otherwise the update is really cool",positive
4597,"App doesnt work without internet connection, everything else is great",positive
4598,"amazing, almost perfect.",positive
4599,"Excellent app, great habit tracker. I've found in this app an exciting way to be productive! There are some bugs and functionalities that need to be fixed, however, it's worth using it. I really recommend it.",positive
4600,"I really like this app, it pleasing on the eyes it's well-designed, has a lot of social features but remains simple so you can focus on your goals not running the app. I would suggest to add an ability for ""gold"" that is currency only valuable to you so that your personal rewards, aka don't work against playing with your avatar and currency of that kind should be able to be exchanged within party. That way you and your friends can gift each other screen time or whatever.",positive
4601,"Started using habitica on January 1st of this year, as a new year's resolution to manage my time and habits better, and it's been a huge help. Especially love the party aspect, and the way it adds social accountability to missing or hitting targets. Very pleased, thank you for all the work that went into this app.",positive
4602,"I love it! One thing I had a problem with earlier was that if I didn't have internet connection, it wasn't possible to log my dailies in. Now I have unlimited data, so this isn't a problem for me anymore, but might be worth solving this for other players. Everything else is just wonderful and a big help to life organization for scattered-mind people like myself 😅",positive
4603,"I love this app so much! They make it really fun for free players too, so you don't feel left out if you don't spend money. I have decided to get a subscription though since it's such a great app. It has my whole family super motivated, my kids are actually loving doing chores! And I also love all the social aspects to it as well. It would be cool of you could assign names for your pets, and the app doesn't function quite the same as the website version, but overall I have no complaints. :)",positive
4604,"This is such a fun way for chores to be rewarded. My household is full of gamers, and this is a great way to create and maintain habits, as well as track chores on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. They are great about getting back to users. They have real conversations, and listen to user feedback.",positive
4605,I am unable to create a new daily. This is the main reason why I downloaded Habitica. The error message says ' ' is not a valid enum value for path 'frequency'. Edit: The app works perfectly now. I've been using it for over 6 months without a single issue. This is the best self improvement app ever created.,positive
4606,"WOW I REALLY LOVE THIS APP!!! Such a great idea. I first downloaded it for my youngest daughter to try help her with responsibility & organization, we connect daily on the app to check each other's progress. I generally enjoy this game, it is the only one have on my phone.",positive
4607,"This app is really unique. It has made me interested again in being productive. It's almost like adopting a lifestyle! However, the app is currently having a problem with task reminders. It doesn't work most of the time and when it does, the alert is usually delayed by approx. 10 minutes. Also, it would be nice if the developers provided the ability to make task lists even when offline. Other than that, the app is perfect! Definitely recommend experiencing it!",positive
4608,This is a superb way to motivate yourself to do things. To create new and healthy/fun habits and get rid of bad habits. Do you want to live a life full of adventures? Be creative and install this amazing app. I would suggest a clearer and friendlier GUI but overall itS AMAZING.,positive
4609,"Ive used this app a couple times now, only uninstalling because school ended, but this app is amazing when it comes down to it. It encourages people to do the stuff that they need to without the complication of being told off by others. Plus, it has a cool rpg theme thats great for anybody who has grown up with/rpg game like elements.",positive
4610,"Fantastic absolutely best of it's kind. No ads, great system of to dos dailies and habits (that you want to have and break) plus the tavern/guild/challenge/quest/party system really keeps you motivated, as does the in art or out of world reward system. Absolutely fantastic.",positive
4611,"It's a delightful app that helps you keep on top of things. Personally, I've found that you get as much as you put into it. There are communities and challenges you can join with like-minded people to help you achieve similar goals, and their are seasonal events as well. There are no adds, no constant pop ups to buy gems, and all features are equally helpful without the gems.",positive
4612,"This app has helped me keep up so many habits and routines. At first I struggled with it a lot, but I soon joined a party. The quests are really helpful to keep me on track, and there are others in the groups to help out too.",positive
4613,"As a Gamer This Makes Life Fun You can make a long of lists of your daily life and gain XP and rewards. You can hatch pets, feed them, ride mounts, find a party to run with, get cool gear, and go on quests. I can see where fun wise there could possibly in the future be expansions for more to come by all means, but right now this really helps to keep on track and makes it so I actually enjoy some part of my life for the first time in a long time outside of my pets.",positive
4614,"Great app for encouraging you to do things! Love that you can personalise your own tasks and play with friends. Would love to see the ability to repeat tasks on weekdays/weekends, instead of just daily/weekly. And an Undo button would be awesome! Sometimes I'll mark something by accident and can't revert what hearts I lost, coins I earned, etc.",positive
4615,"Honestly it's perfect but theres just. One thing. I really wish you could set a habit for 'complete X times a week', it would be so useful. I have yet to find an app that is this good, but that is the only shortcoming. Please add this! I mean of course you dont have to but it would be amazing.",positive
4616,This app has helped me a lot and is all in all one of the best apps I know. There's just one suggestion: I have many habits and dailies hence I have to scroll a lot. It would be amazing if there was an option to change the layout so you can have a better overview.,positive
4617,How to See my completed tasks ? I am confused as I accidentally clicked on done and tasks stopped appearing on the list Obviously. But It creates problem cuz you didn't do but it checked. So please add feature so we can see all our completed tasks upto a month . So we can see our records and edit any possible mistakes. Thank you. Other than this small part This app is best for me. I am requesting you if you can listen us please please add this feature. 🙏🙏🙏 COMPLETED TASKS LIST UPTO A MONTH,positive
4618,"I love Habitica! I am particularly bad at getting things done and this app has helped me improve so much. It's as it says, gamifying your tasks. I am on level 12 and I have only been doing it for a week! If you need a pick me up with your chores and Todo lists then check it out.",positive
4619,"The app didn't work for me at first, but after uninstalling a few times it eventually worked, and I love it! This is great for me as a college student because it makes keeping up with homework and assignments easier by adding an element of fun!",positive
4620,This been really working well with me. The community is great too. It's very useful and the widget is great feature. Though how about costumizing the app theme? Like using different color theme instead of the default purple. Because it will look prettier for my widget :D,positive
4621,"It's a good app. It fuses the entertainment received in playing games with finishing chores, which is pretty hard to pull off. I'll recommend it to anybody who's trying a lot to change their life but easily succumbs to their desires.",positive
4622,"There are options to give your avatar a wheelchair, and there are a lot of colors to choose from, as well as a skinnier body type or a larger one... I don't use a wheelchair, but I just loved this option so much because I have friends who do and it really means a lot to them! So cute lol",positive
4623,"OK, I love the app, it's great, but the notifications just doesn't work, they are broken, and it's the main feature I'm looking for, fix it in order to give you the five starts",positive
4624,"Been using Habitica for a few months. Tried a few other to-do list games, none of them beats Habitica. Best way to keep track of daily life and still have fun.",positive
4625,"I absolutely love this app. First of all, it actually works and give me all the motivation I need to get stuff done. Secondly the community is awesome and there is just so much stuff to do! Recommended to everyone looking to develop habits.",positive
4626,It is an amazingly helpful app I am currently a year 11 student and this has helped tremendously boost my productivity i have seen improvements not only in my results but also me as a person as I lost lots of my bad habits and gained good ones. HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO IMPROVE THEMSELVES (non--academic/academic),positive
4627,"A great app to keep you up and moving, especially being in quarantine :) (this review was made at the time of covid 19)",positive
4628,"Can you give an option to set up timer for every task like 10 minutes or so, to make us more efficient? You can do it by giving us a button to start the timer and the task automatically gets checked once the time is up. And if somebody wants to undo then points will be deducted. Is it possible in any way?",positive
4629,"I love this app, I just wish it wasn't so easy to change your stats and I wish we could delete the default daily tasks. Maybe I can but I'm a dumbass. Idk",positive
4630,"I'm on the quest of improving myself, developing small good habits is pretty easy with this and using this app as a reminder for tasks is awesome.",positive
4631,Great! It's a great game to motivate people to do big stuff who just keep sitting on the sofa and don't want to move.thank you creaters of habitica.😋😁,positive
4632,"Engaging and effective. It doesn't seem to be possible to use a Google Play balance to pay for gems, though.",positive
4633,I've only been on the app for a small time and I can already see the ways in which it can help. Very inclusive and helpful,positive
4634,I really like so far. I makes my daily routine a bit fun and make it meant something in a way.,positive

4637,"I like this app, It is an amazing tool, however I couldn't find calendar and where I can track what I have done. Could you help me find it?",positive
4638,"Cute and entertaining, definitely helping me to stop bad habits!",positive
4639,Has helped me to stay engaged with my to dos in a workable and fun way. Love this app.,positive
4640,"Its actually improved how I do things, and caused me to be more active, I love this app!",positive

4642,This has really helped me be motivated to get things done. Im really enjoying this app,positive
4643,This game/app is so easy to use and so much fun. Thank u so much for making habitica!,positive
4644,"If you're a procrastinator this app will change your life! I have a tendency to avoid the things I need to do by snacking or playing video games so this app has been perfect for me. I'm great at making to-do lists but suck at execution. This app has helped me with so many areas of my life, chores around the house, my quality of work at my job, I've even been using it to develop safer driving habits. The community is also very supportive, it's really fun to play with a friend and party up.",positive
4645,"The game aspect really does motivate me! Especially helpful for doing the dishes. There's a big difference between ""I should do xyz"" and ""I have to do this or I'll lose health points, and I don't want my party to get attacked!""",positive
4646,"I'm really happy with this app - it helps me stay productive, both in school and with my writing goals and even tiny things like just getting out of bed in the morning. I 100% recommend this to anyone who procrastinates as much as I do, because it's really helping me get out the hole I dug myself into with my bad habits.",positive
4647,"If possible please add more advanced equipments and more powerful bosses so that it does not get boring after sometime. There is no purpose to collect pets if they are only for cosmetic purpose. There should be some reward that we can identify ourselves with. For example, there can be a weekly ranking system (say from 1-10000) for all the habiticans so they are more motivated.",positive
4648,"Amazing. Not only is this app cute-to-boot, but it's so easy to use! It doesn't largely focus on the character aspect, which I like because I'm mostly here to organize my life. Everything is covered: To-Do lists, Dailies, Scheduling; its so extremely customizable and in such a simple platform (that I dont have to pay extra for) Not only that, there is the community aspect! Its about holding yourself accountable, and this app is perfect, thank you.",positive
4649,"Love the app! Easily modifiable for making good habits, daily routines, and checklists, and fun to do with friends. Thank you for the your response below: the link allows you to review your history (this has been very helpful for me in realizing where my weaknesses and strengths are). My last wish is to allow friends to see your tasks and completions (for encouragement).",positive
4650,"Habitica is the best! It's so rewarding completing day-to-day tasks with this app. Your avatar can earn gold, equipment, pets, experience by completing the tasks you choose. Joining a questing party is fun because you're with others, holding each other accountable and encouraging one another. Participating in challenges is great because you work on specific aspects of your life, like positive thinking, exercising, reading, ect. Habitica has helped improve my life, and I feel so much happier!",positive
4651,"I've been looking for a habit like tracker via google search, not really knowing the term or if an app really existed. Once I found what I was looking for, Habitica showed up. I installed it to my phone, looked up a YouTube video of it, and began using it. Now I'm hooked and 12 days in getting my life straightened up. Cleaning house, doing daily chores, and doing things I usually hate doing. Habitica just makes it fun to do with it being an RPG. I love it and cannot recommend it enough.",positive
4652,"This app is awesome! I love it not only I'm creating healthy habits, I am also learning thru challenges, you get to talk to people and destroy bosses. Is really awesome. Plus I had some trouble connecting to the game and Alys responded to me quickly and also they fixed it. Shout out to Alys. You guys are doing a good job.",positive
4653,This is a very creative app to keep me amused with my Versa 2 Fitbit and to keep me productive when doing tasks around the house. Excellent job creating this app keep up the great work!!Two thumbs up...👍👍😎🖤,positive
4654,Love it...it has completely changed my life I couldn't have become more adult-like without habitica!!! 😋😊😋😊😊😊,positive
4655,It looks awesome i hope it will help me build good habbits and keep track on my schedule. I wish it could be like a widget on android phone screen as well. And maybe we could write some quotes that motivates us we could see them as notification or something. i love the guild part looks like you can create communities and be part of them. I just download the app today and wanted to share my first impression. Well done :),positive
4656,"This is a fantastic app with a fantastic community-- love this game :) Helped me start sleeping on time and drink water-- anything that you can imagine for yourself, it can help you do!",positive
4657,"Love this concept, love this app. I've been following the development of habitica since it was still only online & I love it! Plus there's plenty of active users to party up & chat with and the devs are always helpful & prompt!! My only gripes are that I wish I could change the colors of my tasks/habits (nitpicky I know lol) & maybe have a notepad area where I can keep habitica-related notes, like a key to the emojis etc I use for myself... And maybe a proper/separate friends list :)",positive
4658,I love Habitica! It's a habit tracker and to-do list that actually motivates me to get things done via the gamification and fun social aspect. The world of Habitica feels like a supportive community of people holding each other accountable and helping each other accomplish their goals. Doing my daily chores is so much more fun when I turn it into a quest for magical potions and eggs!,positive
4659,I refer to this app constantly. It feels super rewarding to do things and keeps me motivated to do the tedious stuff I used to procrastinate on. I love it!!,positive
4660,(Samsung Note 8)Surprisingly robust and easy to use. The game aspect is a nice bonus but the core productivity elements are what make this app awesome.,positive

4662,"A fun way too self check your own habits, smashing support staff help and guide you, you can meet like minded people who are sharing connections and fun in this quaint yet challenging game app. If nothing else I'm remembering my meds on time. Enjoy finding your fun habits see you in Habitica the adventure is there for the taking 😉",positive
4663,"An option for smaller text would be realllly nice and distinguished, it's so big and bulky looking and only fits a couple habits per page. Fun and actually works. it doesn't have a history for or even track your habits tho........ but still best app ever!!!",positive
4664,Great app. Helps me get things done and work on building better habits. Even better when you have a party going with friends. Would be nice if the app had a dark mode that's my only suggestion. Keep up the good work!,positive
4665,"I'm actually willing to pay for the app, just please get the server issue resolved. Seriously, charge one dollar for the app, get a bigger Dev team and resolve any bugs or server issues. The app is actually great aside from that constructive feedback.",positive
4666,"I love Habitica. I love the social aspect of it. If it didn't have the social media portion of it, I probably would have unistalled it as,soon as I installed it. The social portion of it gives me a, reason to check it, and reminds me to try and meet my goals.",positive
4667,Loving it. Would appreciate dark mode as well!,positive
4668,Beautiful programme! I can recommend it for all my friends!,positive
4669,"Review as of 1/4/2020: This is a very great app. It is very useful and helpful, and the bug with some places not loading is fixed.",positive
4670,"Beyond the social part, here we have the best way to take a good habit. Because at each ""bad habit"" you lose health. Same if you don't check a task (daily or to do) to say you did it. And you do not want to lose health. I don't know what happens when it comes to 0 but I do not want to test it. Actually I had another app for habits. It didn't works like Habitica do !",positive
4671,This is an amazing app. I've tried so many habit trackers and todo list type productivity apps. This is the only one that's kept me engaged. And the community is so wonderful.,positive
4672,Pretty good a little buggy with data for example i have more then 0 postive adds to eating 1 fuit and vegi also there should be a cap to tapping like a cap people can set or an option so that acidental tapping dossent happen other then this its a great app,positive
4673,"Why did you change the chat order? :( Now the newest messages are at the bottom, it just feels so unnatural, it was fine before it didn't need a change",positive
4674,Brilliant idea. You are making chores and tracking your habits and progress so much more fun!,positive
4675,This app helps motivate me to complete my personal goals. Love it.,positive
4676,"Thanks for the quick work! Everything works now. I really do like this app and use it on the daily, so I'm glad it's working again",positive
4677,"So glad I found this. Hope it keeps working the way it does, I just installed it. Just keeps getting better and better so far I absolutely love it :)",positive
4678,I've always had such a hard time motivating myself to do things like chores. This app has made such a difference! It really gives me a sense of accountability. Highly recommend to anyone who just can't seem to get things done.,positive
4679,"THIS IS THE BEST APP EVER. I am a very procrastinative person from a long time ago, so I decided to improve my life. I suffered so much because I did things I didn't needed to do in the wrong time. But Habitica was there to help me rewarding me to use my time wisely :3 THANK YOOOOOOOU :DDD",positive
4680,Must download. The app is very much useful. It had helped me get on track when I wasn't in a position of self reflection.,positive

4688,Simple and rewarding. The updates are amazing.,positive
4689,"Love this app ☺ Devs always fix issues quickly, too.",positive

4705,Good game like real game 👌👌👌,positive
4706,"I love Habitica! I am particularly bad at getting things done and this app has helped me improve so much. It's as it says, gamifying your tasks. I am on level 12 and I have only been doing it for a week! If you need a pick me up with your chores and Todo lists then check it out.",positive
4707,"Fantastic absolutely best of it's kind. No ads, great system of to dos dailies and habits (that you want to have and break) plus the tavern/guild/challenge/quest/party system really keeps you motivated, as does the in art or out of world reward system. Absolutely fantastic.",positive
4708,Is there a black theme coming up?,positive
4709,Awesome,positive
4710,"Ive used this app a couple times now, only uninstalling because school ended, but this app is amazing when it comes down to it. It encourages people to do the stuff that they need to without the complication of being told off by others. Plus, it has a cool rpg theme thats great for anybody who has grown up with/rpg game like elements.",positive
4711,Love this,positive
4712,This really helped me hone my time management skills while at home and helped me to stick to a daily routine. Wonderful. I love the video game aspect of it! So interesting! Brings back childhood memories. 😊,positive
4713,"I really like this app, it pleasing on the eyes it's well-designed, has a lot of social features but remains simple so you can focus on your goals not running the app. I would suggest to add an ability for ""gold"" that is currency only valuable to you so that your personal rewards, aka don't work against playing with your avatar and currency of that kind should be able to be exchanged within party. That way you and your friends can gift each other screen time or whatever.",positive
4714,This app helps motivate me to complete my personal goals. Love it.,positive
4715,"Been using Habitica for a few months. Tried a few other to-do list games, none of them beats Habitica. Best way to keep track of daily life and still have fun.",positive
4716,Great app!,positive
4717,"I love it! One thing I had a problem with earlier was that if I didn't have internet connection, it wasn't possible to log my dailies in. Now I have unlimited data, so this isn't a problem for me anymore, but might be worth solving this for other players. Everything else is just wonderful and a big help to life organization for scattered-mind people like myself 😅",positive

4719,Amazing even if you are not a nerd really helpful.,positive

4722,"I love this app so much! They make it really fun for free players too, so you don't feel left out if you don't spend money. I have decided to get a subscription though since it's such a great app. It has my whole family super motivated, my kids are actually loving doing chores! And I also love all the social aspects to it as well. It would be cool of you could assign names for your pets, and the app doesn't function quite the same as the website version, but overall I have no complaints. :)",positive

4744,"This is such a fun way for chores to be rewarded.

4748,"Great app for encouraging you to do things! Love that you can personalise your own tasks and play with friends. Would love to see the ability to repeat tasks on weekdays/weekends, instead of just daily/weekly. And an Undo button would be awesome!

4756,"It's a delightful app that helps you keep on top of things. Personally, I've found that you get as much as you put into it. There are communities and challenges you can join with like-minded people to help you achieve similar goals, and their are seasonal events as well. There are no adds, no constant pop ups to buy gems, and all features are equally helpful without the gems.",positive
4757,Loving it. Would appreciate dark mode as well!,positive
4758,I've always been wanting one of these!!,positive
4759,"There are options to give your avatar a wheelchair, and there are a lot of colors to choose from, as well as a skinnier body type or a larger one...

4762,Very good 🍀,positive
4763,This app has helped me a lot and is all in all one of the best apps I know. There's just one suggestion: I have many habits and dailies hence I have to scroll a lot. It would be amazing if there was an option to change the layout so you can have a better overview.,positive
4764,"It's a good app. It fuses the entertainment received in playing games with finishing chores, which is pretty hard to pull off. I'll recommend it to anybody who's trying a lot to change their life but easily succumbs to their desires.",positive

4773,Would love love LOVE LOVE an offline mode. I spend 3 days a week without internet and have trouble keeping on top of my life without structure like apps like these. This would be the one for me if it could also go offline :(,positive
4774,"This app is really unique. It has made me interested again in being productive. It's almost like adopting a lifestyle! However, the app is currently having a problem with task reminders. It doesn't work most of the time and when it does, the alert is usually delayed by approx. 10 minutes. Also, it would be nice if the developers provided the ability to make task lists even when offline. Other than that, the app is perfect! Definitely recommend experiencing it!",positive
4775,Loved it,positive
4776,It's fun and easy to use.,positive
4777,"As a Gamer This Makes Life Fun You can make a long of lists of your daily life and gain XP and rewards. You can hatch pets, feed them, ride mounts, find a party to run with, get cool gear, and go on quests. I can see where fun wise there could possibly in the future be expansions for more to come by all means, but right now this really helps to keep on track and makes it so I actually enjoy some part of my life for the first time in a long time outside of my pets.",positive
4778,"Honestly it's perfect but theres just. One thing. I really wish you could set a habit for 'complete X times a week', it would be so useful. I have yet to find an app that is this good, but that is the only shortcoming. Please add this! I mean of course you dont have to but it would be amazing.",positive
4779,Really interesting apps!,positive
4780,"Can you give an option to set up timer for every task like 10 minutes or so, to make us more efficient? You can do it by giving us a button to start the timer and the task automatically gets checked once the time is up. And if somebody wants to undo then points will be deducted. Is it possible in any way?",positive
4781,This been really working well with me. The community is great too. It's very useful and the widget is great feature. Though how about costumizing the app theme? Like using different color theme instead of the default purple. Because it will look prettier for my widget :D,positive
4782,Ok,positive
4783,It's a cool app. I have enjoyed using it.,positive
4784,Cannot log in.,positive

4791,"to be honest, i love this app, really useful and tackles productivity in a fun way, but since im traveling so much i cant have a consistent internet connection so i cant use it sadly, offline use would be so appreciated, even with less stuff to use, sadly i know that wont happen soon",positive

4800,I have purchased pro version. I plant a tree for an hour and come after an hour to see the forest destroyed. It has happened more than 3 times. I even left the phone on the app itself. Kindly fix this. When you don't get to see the reward after 3 hours of productive time it really gets irritating and makes me think why did I even purchase this app. Kindly help.,negative

4862,Excellent idea but doesn't really work as intended. All I do is use the app when I know I definitely won't need my phone and obviously this isn't what it was designed for. I'm not using my phone less at all.

I use ecosia and I planted over 400 trees web surfing. The sounds are useless too as you can get tons of sounds on other app effortlessly.,negative

4951,I hate to say but ur app sucks. It automatically stops and deletes a tree or seed score. It hangs and Even crashes so many times. I can't even contact you for support. I spend 600 s from 1146 s left with 546 which got automatically deducted to 200. I mean how on Earth this is happening.,negative

Life is full of things that pop up out the blue and in its current state you loose all progress or get rewarded for doing nothing. Please, please, please add an optional pause button. There are already a bunch of optional thing to tweak it please add this. I would go Pro in a heart beat and it would become my top app.",negative
4968,"It's useful. I wasn't sure how good it'd be at keeping me focused, but it really does help--and it shows me how much I use my phone. Also, the gardens are quite pretty. I would like more realistic varieties of plants and for it to not be so expensive to plant real trees, though. Seems fitting to be able to plant trees in real life with every tree you plant. I'd be much more willing to recommend this app to people if I could plant a real tree with every full tree I plant in the app.",negative

My account wasn't authenticating, so I logged out. When I tried to log back in, it didn't recognize my email (even using Forgot Password).

5003,"Great app to keep focused but too many glitches as you can tell from other reviews. For me it has crashed in the passed. Currently the problem is that the vibration alarm doesn't come on when I'm done my timer, so it's literally failing at it's secondary job, to keep time of your session (1st job is to keep your phone away from you during your study session). Because of the glitch, I have missed a bus a couple times b/c the timer didn't ring. I am displeased. Also the new updates seem unoriginal",negative
5004,"Update: I did all the steps.. still not working... It is getting frustrating 😓 I really love this app. But off late it just keeps crashing. Can anybody help? Updated: Thanks for the reply!

Now rather than being able to watch an ad for double coins at the end of a session I earn the same base coins with the option to pay real money for increased coin earning. I already paid for pro mode! And pro mode feels entirely necessary for the white listing feature. Without it even apps like a music player or calculator, that are sometimes required to be used while you are focusing, will kill your tree. I feel ripped off.",negative
5006,"It's an interesting idea, but this app missed some extremely important features, namely: a landscape mode, as well as a custom notification sound. Why? Those are extremely easy features to add! My use case is placing my phone on a stand in landscape mode so I can charge it while at work. I want a custom notification sound at work, and I want to be able to watch the timer go down without the screen stuck in portrait. Also, I keep the screen on, and the app disses me because I have the app open.",negative

5013,"Such a waste of such a great app. Would have given it five stars if it didn't constantly crash, causing it to either not open once time's up unless I force close (losing my tree) or not notifying me in the first place as it crashed halfway through (and again losing my tree). I hope this can be fixed in the near future because I'm not willing on giving up on this app this soon",negative
5014,The app won't open anymore and before that i couldn't log into my account. Pls sort out! One suggestion I would like to make is the option to arrange the trees and bushes the way we want. It's a good app just struggling to get it to work.,negative
5015,"Not worth! When i use other apps it keeps the timer on. What's the reason behind it god knows! I can't even get other species of plant as bcoz as soon as i try to do so.....

5016,Used to really love this app and it really helped me start working until I found out that none of my trees die when I switch apps. Tried all the instructions in the FAQs section of their website but nothing worked. Great idea but super disappointed it doesn't work in my phone.,negative

5028,Your app was gud but when i did reset my phone and install this again app doesn't work properly i can do whatever i want it doesn't protect me to other apps... If i use other apps while tree is growing they don't die... Your app is really useless,negative
5029,Waa supposed to try premium but my payment won't push through. It keeps saying that I have the wrong google password when in fact I inputed the correct one.,negative
5030,"I like this app, but its useless. If i go on a different app, it just gives me a warning and carries on. Would be better if there was some sort of consequence for using other apps.",negative
5031,The sad thing is that it didn't allow to sync data. It requires pro version to be purchased,negative
5032,I find the concept of this app absolutely stupid I don't think people are gonna care about if a virtual plant dies if u use an app and the only thing it does is give u a notification as an incentive. What the app should do is whenever someone opens an app forest should open and display over the app this will prevent others from casually using other apps while their work is in progress.,negative
5033,This has helped me so much ❤️ I love the app but I swear my coins disappear?!? Anyone else having this issue?,negative
5034,Updated to the latest version and the store would not load anymore plus my trees planted for the day does not record anymore,negative

5038,This app is just impossible to use without the whitelist functionality which got removed from the free version. Great shame.,negative

5040,I purchased it but it still showing i dont have premium account. The money is debited from my account but i haven't get premium app. Please consider this.,negative
5041,Few days after downloading it shows that forest app can't open or open app again .,negative
5042,I like the options available but for some reason I can still go into other apps when I am planting. Only after I go back into the app does it give me the notification. Could I get some help?,negative
5043,The main purpose of this app is to not allow us to open other apps like social media. However when I accessed other apps after pressing the home button I could use them(note:my wifi was off)The app was running in the background while i could use my phone completely.Please fix it. And a suggestion would be to put a feature to select some apps we want to access while doing our work(other than calls) like 'notes'. I need some apps while I study(like I keep important notes I need while I study),negative
5044,Update: The app crashes everyday and I have to reinstall it and customize my settings everyday. I have a premium account but still this happens. Please help! This app is life transforming. I've been using it everyday for four to five hours and I'm getting so much more done. I love it! The only issue is that it crashes frequently and I need to keep uninstalling it and then reinstalling it. It'd be great if the developers looked into that.,negative
5045,Good app but once you pay for premium you get half the amount of coins as you're no longer able to watch ads for double coins. You'd assume you just get double coins as standard after paying. It also kills trees when you get a phone call even if you dont answer it which is frustrating,negative
5046,For some weird reason the app (timer) stopped working after a few months of installing the app. I used to use it everyday but now all I can do is uninstall it. it's kinda weird how this is an editors choice app. I would give this a five star if this was fixed. and it would be much better if this was not a timer. I would much more prefer if you can add a start button and when you finished studying you can just stop it instead. you can't really estimate the time it takes for you to study.,negative
5047,I can't even enter the shop :( I want to get more trees but the app just keeps loading...,negative
5048,App has so many problems. I started experiencing them once I paid for the pro version. No one has responded me back from the support to solve my issues. Some issues are as below. 1. Not fully supporting the app whitelist which is a big obstacle in working. 2. Not counting the exceeded time even after setting it up again and again. 3. Took so long to log in after reinstallation as I tried that to solve the above mentioned issues. My advice : Don't pay for this app till these issues are resolved,negative
5049,"I loved this app for a long time, however since an update early in the year the app keeps killing my tree randomly part way through the timer despite me not unlocking or sometimes even touching my phone. I contacted the dev and gave it 6 months in hopes it would be resolved, but unfortunately it looks like this app isn't for me anymore. I hope it works better on your phone! When it works it's great!",negative
5050,"Good concept but simply doesn't work, I can still use every single app without any intrusion, the tree doesn't even die when I close the app and restart it, totally broken",negative
5051,The idea is better than the execution. Buying things from the store requires you to create an account in their app rather than using the play store account. Creating an account requires you to enter a birthday which uses a horrible calendar form that requires you to arrow-over every month in every year until you get to your birthday. I'm not doing that... The sound turns off randomly (before the end of the session). Switching to another app doesn't trigger in session warning consistently.,negative
5052,"I purchased the premium version and now I can't buy new plants, errors keep happening and I would like to go back to the free version without loosing my forest. I have the newest version so it should be so glitchy. Once it's fixed it will get 5 stars.",negative
5053,"I re-installed this app last week and it's been great but recently it won't plant the tree when I press PLANT. It shows the countdown in notifications, but the actual app keeps showing the Planting screen with nothing happening, which kinda defeats the purpose of the app.",negative

5056,Well.. it worked perfectly fine for 2 days ... now it freezes after the vibration during completion of time.. The record of work also failed to register after it force closes itself... example : Today i have studied like 4hours constantly and it only registered 60mins of work.. rest of the time it freezed right after the completion.. uninstalling such a huge app...,negative
5057,"While the concept is good, the app doesn't work. In my case the app doesn't detect if I open other apps so my tree keeps growing even if I open other apps. Also I noticed that I would reach for my phone more after installing the app. It may work for others but not for me.",negative
5058,"As much as I love the concept and I really do want to use it, the app doesn't log my times. I'll plant, and study, then when I come back (and my tree is supposed to be done growing) it'll just start up like nothing happened. I've had an empty forest for two days now.",negative

5060,"I just LOVE this app sooo much. It helps me a llot in focusing on my studies. But many times it crasehes at the very last second. I've lost millions of trees, re-installed and reported thousand times but unfortunately no improvement.",negative
5061,I have a lg k30 phone and after an update the app no longer kills trees when I try and open another app. This happens if the whitelist is on or off and if advance detecion is on or off. If this gets fix then this app deserves the 4.6 overall rating that is has.,negative
5062,This is the 10th or 11th time that I installed this app after uninstalling as it keeps crashing all the time.. application is very helpful to focus on work/study except that it doesn't work properly. I am just fed up of reinstalling this app everytime.,negative

5064,The app stop responding for many days already! It is disturbing that it stops after 5 secs whenever i open the app - STILL STOPPING,negative
5065,"The new ''double reward"" feature is very upsetting and cheapening. The whole point of this app is to help you focus and reduce phone distraction, not barage you with ads for developer profit",negative
5066,"I don't like the new update. Now trees for 25 min are worth the same as trees for 10. It does not seem fair at all. Also, the trees at the store are now more expensive. I don't like the update at all.",negative

One of these being the similarities in structure between this app and others such as Grammarly.

5397,"So it's a good app. Two things: 1. Sometimes I'll get back on after a really long session and my tree will have died for no reason. When I check the button that tells you, it's just a random app that I hadn't opened that day. Its happened several times and it makes me really sad so please fix this. 2. I can't get the app to let me access any other apps. Sometimes I will use it for homework so I don't get side tracked but I can't open a calculator without sacrificing the life of my tree. I wish you could select apps that would be okay to stay on. Please fix these two things and I will give you 5 stars for sure!!!",neutral
5398,"I genuinely think it is great, but I feel like there are still a lot of features that still can be improved. One of them is the whitelist feature. I bought the premium version in app, but I am not satisfied with it. The reason for that is the whitelist give to much leniency when planting trees. I plant the trees for various different reasons such as studying, excersising, relaxing, etc. However, I need some apps to be available in certain activity while unavailable in others. My suggestion is to apply different whitelists for different tags of activities. This will surely help me to be less distracted by other apps during a certain activity. I hope this improvement will be made and if so, I will gladly changed my ratings of the app.",neutral
5399,"The app is absolutely amazing, but with the loss of the whitelist feature, I can't set apps to be allowed to switch to. I do *not* want to pay extra for a feature that used to be free. Especially since I use my phone for most tasks through the day and I like having the ability to allow those apps to be opened workout killing the tree. Also, the tree dies when you get a call now, or when replying to notifications, which I used to be able to fix with the whitelist, but I'm just left with a ton of withered trees now.",neutral

5412,"Well I like the app and it truly helps me stay focused, combined with some time restriction methods it's good (although those ones are short times plus breaks), achievements are boring and not good enough, they try to make you pay for extra, but the app itself is not exciting enough to pay, the achievements are not really worth it and it's hard to unlock new trees even with pro version. No new campaigns are launched & collecting coins is not an easily achievable task, too hard to get new trees.",neutral

Yes, the required permission to monitor your usage of other apps seems reasonably well-motivated by the stated purpose of classifying your phone usage as focused vs unfocused phone.

5576,Kept on crashing. Have been installing and uninstalling a few times and still kept crashing.,neutral
5577,good idea and work i would like to give it 5 stars if you solve my problem im using asus zenfone 3 max and app not able to detect my usage of other apps and plant never withers even if i close the app i give every permission it demands but it still continues im pro version user by the way,neutral
5578,"Tbh I like this app, when I installed for first time but now this app always force close😪",neutral
5579,Real🎉ly good,neutral
5580,Initially the app worked really well but now it is not opening and I dnt know what to do. I also tried clearing the data bt the issue still remains.,neutral
5581,It really helps in focusing but there is this premium thing so I cannot do many stuff. I think you have to pay or get the premium thing to plant trees in real life but I like how there's this different kind of trees and stuff like it has music!!,neutral
5582,"Please help!! The app keeps crashing after some automatic update. It refuses to open after the crash. Have to reinstall it everytime until it crashes again. Have done this the 6th time. Being a pro user I get to sign in and retrieve the data, but still loses lot of time and momentum doing all this installing and reinstalling thing after each crash. BTW Amazing app helped me focus and have goals in life!",neutral
5583,Phone/computer sync could be improved. Also doesn't have a timer for your rest between pomodoros.,neutral
5584,"it keeps crashing just when i paid premium! Devs pls help me. i really wanna use this app. As soon as i open it, it crashes and end abruptly. i am hoping for your quick response. Thank you",neutral
5585,"I love using forest as a timer when I study, however there is the ethical issue that you can't plant real trees unless you have premium. This really frustrates me because they took an opportunity to help the environment and turned it into an opportunity to make money. I understand that they need the money from buying premium to plant the trees, but it feels like they are making people feel guilty in order to sell premium to them. Thank you for the response, I appreciate you taking the time.",neutral
5586,Ever since the new update that came out today I have not been able to use forest. Every time I try opening the app is says forest has stopped. Is there any way to fix this?,neutral
5587,How to equip those new purchased trees??????,neutral
5588,Good!,neutral
5589,"Love the app!! But since the update, it closes every time i try to access the store",neutral
5590,Can improve if u can add to do list,neutral
5591,Nice,neutral
5592,Helps me to stay focused ♡,neutral
5593,If i leave the app nothing happened. 🤷‍♀️,neutral
5594,It's good but App keep crushing after exit from the app and I reenter 😭,neutral
5595,"This app is really good but I have a major issue with it. It helps you focus, not to get distracted but sometimes I need to a calculator or google or a dictionary I can't because my tree will die!! So I need to exit the app(the tree is still growing) and then I can access google or what not please let the app access certain apps if possible.",neutral
5596,"I've used this app before and I like it. The only issue is there are no breaks, it's kind of difficult to study and have no breaks.",neutral
5597,"perfect to temporarily ""forget"" my phone",neutral
5598,"This app is great! I've used it for a year now, but I find that the app was preferable prior to the update. I really don't like that the plant only changes or ""evolves"" with at least 60 minutes. Now it feels like anything under that does not matter. If I focus for 10 minutes or 50 minutes makes no difference in the app, which is a little demotivating. Please consider changing this. Other than that, phenomenal app.",neutral
5599,"The app idea is great on itself. However, there are too many options blocked behind the pro version which one would think are basic: whitelist and exporting the progress (changing phones makes all the progress be lost). Moreover, although not essential, some free achievements would also be nice, even if they don't give any coins. I'm willing to change my rating if I see any of those changes, since like I said, the app is quite good already (free version feels like less than a free trial...)",neutral
5600,"I love this app so much, I've had it for almost a week and I've only found one bad thing about it. It's absolutely adorable and it's helped me stay off my phone and make it fun to do so. The problem I've had is that when I get video chat requests from Instagram my trees die but I fixed it by muting video chat requests. Overall it's super fun :)",positive
5601,"I like this app and i use it everyday for studying and reaching the amount of time i wanna stay focused on my works that need to be done, everything is great but i really wish there were an option for us to choose the apps that we need during doing our works and tasks,i've study apps and websites i need to use but i can't because of this limit,therefore i won't plant trees, i wish you could give us options about the apps we wanna use and the ones we don't.It's rly a problem. please fix this! Tnx",positive
5602,"After the latest update, the forest has been removed. Coin count and tree purchase history is up-to-date, but the entire forest is gone. Synchronization does not fix the issue. I did not reinstall app as per the in-app warning not to. What the hell? Update: after two weeks issue was fixed",positive
5603,"Really helpful app, but there's one problem. You can leave the app by clicking the home button and your tree keeps growing while you do other stuff on your phone, which means it doesn't really prevent you from leaving the app. Hope this is fixed because I really like this!",positive
5604,"A beautiful app but.. I would love an option where you dont have to set a time, you just put it on and watch the trees grow as you work and come back to your phone an hour or two hours, whenever youre done! I also found that trees die if I dont come back fast enough after my timer expires? Like if I set my timer for 1 hour and I come back in 2 Ill find the tree died, thats weird, is that a bug on my end? Beautiful app guys, I love it but those things above would have me using it more!",positive
5605,its a really good app and it motivates me to get my work done!!! thank you so much for making this app!!! the only problem is that yu have to pay for the whitelist because there are times when i need to surf the web while doing my work and i can't do that so maybe you could remive whitelist from premium? its a great app but sometimes i can't work with it due to the premium . Thanks once again for the great app!!!,positive
5606,"I love the app! It's a great way to stay focused, especially with all the quarantining going on. However, I have one issue with this app: the ambient noises you can play don't loop properly, and become glitchy if you let them play for too long.",positive
5607,"The app idea is great, but the actual app is kinda slow and a bit confusing to get around. The concept is very simple, yet the user interface is way too complex and has many features that I bet nobody really uses. Less buttons, more trees.",positive
5608,"The app is good.. But we can overide this by changing the system time manually to future.. Ideally after turning on the time the app shouldn't hv allowed to change the screen, even to home screen or settings screen.. Then this could have been perfect. But android system may not allow to do so..",positive
5609,"I am quite liking this app.I could stay more focused than before.But o flaw that i met in this app is that U cannot pause the time. People may have to do something else or something important but then they have to give up and go to that work which results in whithering of one plant. Maybe you could provide a pause button but also take a note that if anyone hits press and opens any other app,it should automatically stop. Please keep that in mind.",positive
5610,"I really like this app especially the natural noises. it makes me feel so calm..but for some reason even though I made the app ""on"" in the settings it still asks me to do so...it's nothing really...REALLY RECOMMEND IT.",positive
5611,I love this app a lot but it keeps closing everytime I try to use it after a couple of inactive days. It have to keep uninstalling and installing it. Please fix this problem soon!! I really enjoy this app!,positive
5612,This app is really usefull but i didn't figure so far how to set the app to wiyher my trees whenever i exit it/ use other apps while planting. I saw a set of instructions but nine were helpful for the Samsung device i posses. I need to say i really except an answer that can help me solve my problem,positive
5613,"This app is cute and a great option to just setting a timer when working/studying. However, several times I have gotten a wilted tree just because some other app sent me notifications when I myself did not touch my phone. :(",positive
5614,"Very good app the only thing is that the minimum time is ten minutes and a lot of times I want to concentrate for five minutes. Otherwise, really cute and it works correctly.",positive
5615,"I love the app so I decided to install it again to keep up with school work, it works amazing but my screen is very dark, my phone brightness is all the way up but the app isnt bright but instead very dark. This has never happened before. How do I fix this?",positive
5616,i am using pro version and its pretty well organised applicatiom among its competitors. but my suggestion is that please make a significant difference in tree for varioua time period. for example most of tree looks same at evry time period,positive
5617,"the app is good but in the over view section , even though i have focused for 45 minutes or some hour straight , it always show the data as 2 different phases. example-》45minutes=21minute then 24 minute.",positive
5618,"The app concept is so great.It drives people to work on.but there is an issue when i try to remove withered trees.I click on watch ad to remove,then it opens an ad but suddenly disappears the ad and it doesn't remove my wethered trees.",positive
5619,"It's a good app, but has some errors, if a close the app, a can use every app of my phone for example, it will be more fun if one can interactore with the forest play with it or change the form idk.",positive
5620,"Very good app for focus, has helped me on more than one occasion. I will say though, the audio it plays, if you choose to play it, sometimes glitches out on my Galaxy S9. It will sometimes just shut off and refuse to play even when my volume is on and the sound option is on. Otherwise though, its a very good focus app, great for people like me who get easily distracted by their phones.",positive
5621,Forest is a gamification of the pomodoro technique. It's more helpful than other pomodoro-type apps. The vibration notification is too long and loud. Otherwise an excellent app.,positive
5622,This is a great app...helps me a lot...but I have 2 problems: 1.the app doesn't give notifications on time when the time is up.....it used to give proper notifications before...but for the past 2 weeks it doesn't sound on time. 2. another problem is that I'm not getting the coins I earned ! Sometimes when the notification doesn't come (as described above) I don't get any coins and the timer resets itself without awarding me my coins. I request you to fix these 2 problems as soon as possible !,positive
5623,"I really love the app! But I have one suggestion though, I hope you make the trees animated so users can have a better experience and enjoy their forest more! Nevertheless, this app is 💣",positive
5624,Best Pomodoro app. There's only two things that I'd wish they included. 1.) I wish they allowed portrait mode so I can have my phone propped up sideways. 2.) Could you guys please allow this app to take up the WHOLE screen so I don't get distracted by notification icons or the time?,positive
5625,My mother was saying your maximum time limit was two hours with the phone.but I always did more. This app allowed me to stay focused on something else really recommend it.,positive
5626,A great way to keep myself focused. I enjoy the different tree options and seeing the forests i grow every day. Good way to measure my producticity levels too.,positive
5627,"The idea is great. I've used it many times to stay focused and stay on task. I enjoy the fact that you can write lil bios of on your trees. However, the app would be tremendously more useful if I were able to restrict certain apps for a period of time rather than not using my phone at all. I still want to use certain apps, like music and reading apps, rather than not having access to my phone at all.",positive
5628,"Nothing is ideal, but this app helped me to write a song and make my own project. It's funny, that same time I grow a beautiful garden. Thanks)",positive
5629,"Okay I think it's kinda working now but the only one suggestion. I'm not sure if it's like this on every phone or just mine, but I remember the old version used to automatically bring you back to the growing tree as soon as you attempt to open an app, but now it only send notification preview to the notification bar instead. If the developer did change it, I wish they would bring the old style back. I need a bit of forcing lol",positive
5630,"It is really a useful app and I liked it, But I have a proplem that my tree doesn't die when I leave the app. It actually blocks me from using apps, but when I remove it from the background (tapping the right button and remove it by scrolling up), I can open any app and forest stops working. What I want exacly is to make my tree die when I leave forest and never be able to use apps when I try to do so during focusing time. Please tell me if there is any solution for this and thank you so much.",positive
5631,"It's good overall. It has a variety of cute options for trees. I had some issues with an alarm I'd forgotten about going off from another app & causing a tree to die unless I watched an ad. It takes a long time to get enough coins to buy other trees. There isn't a formula available to estimate how long it would take. Discouraging. I liked the idea that was posted about having animals get drawn to healthy forests over time. I wanted pro several times, but don't trust myself with whitelist.",positive
5632,I had a great experience but i gave 4 stars because the time is only for 25 minutes and again we have to open our phone to set a new timer and get distracted.. The best thing abt this app is that it has very relaxing sounds that help us to focus and concentrate on anything which we do ... I would be really happy if u increase the timer to 1 or 2 hrs ... Thanks,positive
5633,"I love this app so much! It helps me stay focused and on task while I'm in class and at home studying. I recommend this for any student struggling to put down the phone and focus on school! The reward system is amazing and I can wait to unlock more plants as i progress. As a nature lover, I live for the idea of helping out the REAL life environment aswell, which is an amazing feature of this app. The only down side is that it sometimes crashes, which is frustrating but I can get past that.",positive
5634,It's a great concept to get work done or take a break from the phone. It would be nice if there was an option to time yourself and grow a tree while doing work on the phone itself like working on Google Docs for instance... If the app allows you to identify some work apps and use only those while the tree grows.,positive
5635,"Thanks for the tech support! The app wasn't working properly before, but now it runs fine. The only probkem is that when I press the home button, the tree doesn't die and the ambient sounds still play like the app is still open. But it's fine because the tree will die if I go into any another app.",positive
5636,"It's not a bad concept at all, and I'm happy it helps in real life too... but I was excited for the whitelist feature and it's only available for purchase. Most of the work I do involves other apps so I wont use it often at all. For those who don't need other apps it's a great thing to have. I'll use it when I'm reading, doing homework that's not online, etc. Just wish I could do more.",positive
5637,"I love this app! It helps me to stay focused while studying, or to not use my phone when I'm around other people.",positive
5638,Kinda wish price tiers weren't so high but that's not that big of a deal. I guess premium is better but I can't get that at the moment so eh. Actually I do have one complaint. I don't think syncing forest from the chrome extention to your phone should require the premium version. That's just me though,positive
5639,"Was great earlier,but stopped functioning after the update!! I guess it is not compatible with some android devices. This is really bad.People out there are shifting to an alternative app called Focus Plant. Would really appreciate if all devices are supported.Edit: working now-For those whos tree is not dying,go to settings and disable the option-Lock forest to stay in foreground.Developer pls note.",positive
5640,"It is an app with a good concept in mind. Only have to spend $1 to start putting your time to planting real trees. The downside is that you have a limit of planting only 5 trees. After I reached my limit, I started to lose motivation to use the app just to plant virtual trees.",positive
5641,"Honestly L O V E this app already and I've only had it for, like, 30 minutes but there seems to be a small bug after the timer finishes. I don't know if it's intentional but the pop up that gives you coins just keeps... Popping up? I get 10 coins, I press ""okay"" then another pop up comes, giving me another 10 coins. It doesn't end until I have to remove the app from my history. Despite that this is an AMAZING app for studying ❤️",positive
5642,"I love this app very much but I've been having trouble recently with it. After a single use, it keeps shutting off by itself. Apparently, it shows me an error that I've not downloaded the latest version of it even though I have and even after deleting and reinstalling it back, it keeps glitching. I don't know what to do D:",positive
5643,"Amazing app, keeps me off my phone when I need to be productive, but, it's been having some glitches lately. I've been trying to open it and it just opens itself and closes again. It only works if I uninstall it and then install it again. Hope to see this issue fixed.",positive
5644,"I really like the idea and it does help me with staying focused, but reminder notifications don't always pop up. It's also a bit slow at times when loading a new screen, and some screens look a bit dated but it's fine. Anyways I love the feature of being able to plant real trees, I'm looking forward to plant one!",positive
5645,It's a great app to stay focused but sometimes I use my phone to go on Google or use Google translate or dictionary and other things that I need to do my work. I think the app should let us choose which apps can be an exception because phones are sometimes very important in doing our work. Restrict only games and social media.,positive
5646,"I love this app ❤️! I would, however, like if you could add something more to make the app feel even more polished and more peaceful. For instance: animals that wonder around your forest and the healthier the forest the more animals come or you could move your trees and add rivers. Worth the $2.00 for premium. Very good for big groups to focus. I love the store and the fact that you can buy different trees to grow, get different sounds, and music.",positive
5647,"Overall I love the app but with the most recent update I'm experiencing an issue where it appears trees cost more coins than they display. For instance, I cannot purchase a 600 coin tree with 673 coins because I don't have enough coins. Also last night I had 1272 coins and bought a 600 coin tree, bringing my balance down to 501. If this could be fixed, I'd love to go to 5 stars. I literally use this app all the time.",positive
5648,Really great tool helps me to know what do I spend my most time doing and I strongly recommend it to everyone. It would be a better experience if they could add a feature to give me the freedom to organize my own forest and change the way my trees are put,positive
5649,"Its a Productive app.Helps me to have my focus off the phone.The concept of planting variety of plants and trees eventually having a beautiful virtual forest of yours(I'm using the free version) is outstanding.Not to mention the ambient sound feature(not explored yet).I'm happy to find this app. Suggestions : Add more varieties of plants,trees & decoratives in the store.Also, add animals in the store, it will bestow in users the idea of having wildlife in their virtual forest. Thank you",positive
5650,"It really helps me being productive, but maybe you could make it more worth it to continue after the time has ran out? Like get more money or a medal or something because personally i feel like doing more than you planned should be rewarded.",positive
5651,"3/5 cool idea, but way too many adds - opposite of making someone ""focus"" Edit 4.5/5 (after purchasing pro v) Pretty good. I wish there was a way to adjust the time goal to be something else other than 25 min. Or instead of trees being different at 60 min, 1.5 hrs. Etc. Some trees shld be diff at 40 min, 50 min etc.",positive
5652,Hello! I love the app as the tree is cute and creative. However my tree doesn't die when i press the homescreen button for forest. It doesn't die when i leave the app and go to another app. What i want is the tree to die when i leave the app so that i can increase my focus and productivity in doing work. Help please?,positive
5653,"The app is awesome. Really wish you could tag and name trees before you plant them. That would be a nice quality-of-life change. Also, if you could make the app more compatible for chromebooks, that would be nice too. Chromebooks are excellent work computers and I need a good working app on it. I really hope forest can work in the future.",positive
5654,"Awesome app, really. Especially for students managing their time. My friend actually introduced it to me and I would be glad that we could view each others' profil without using the Pro thing. Like, we can remain focuse TOGETHER even if we don't live near each other.",positive
5655,"I'd assume the preferred behavior is for user to focus for longer periods than shorter periods. But the rewards are exact opposite, I 6 coins for two 10 minute sessions but only 5 for one 20 minute session. Your point system must change.",positive
5656,I love the white noise feature. It helps me stay focused on the task at hand.,positive
5657,"I really love this app! It has really nice plants and gives you rewards too! The only thing that I don't like is that now when you exit the forest app, it doesn't force you to come back. Last year, in 2019, I experienced that when I exited the app, it would force me to come back. Pls fix this",positive
5658,"I love what this app is doing and what they are attempting to achieve but at times when I try and double my coins, it does not get added to the overall total. It's a small thing but I hate watching adds just to not receive the reward. 🤷",positive
5659,This app is very helpful for me to cut back from Phubing and spend time staying focused for as long as I wish. There's only the problem of the crashing of this app oftentimes. Please do fix it. And thank you♥️.,positive
5660,"I've had this app for a while and I love it. But after the last update it hasn't notified me that my time is up. The tree is planted but my phone doesn't go off. All the notifications it could have are turned on, so I don't know why this is. Help, please?",positive
5661,"I really like the app, it has really helped me focus on study and work without distraction. I love unlocking new trees from the coins you earn, but I wish there were a little less expensive. Overall a really great free app!",positive
5662,This app is a bit laggy sometimes but overall I have gotten alot of help from this app especially during my exams. It helps you stay focused. As the name suggests you have to build a forest and the more focused you are the bigger your forest gets. It is a really fun app.,positive
5663,Really great! I have trouble staying focused on my studies but this had me studying uninterrupted for hours on end. I live all the great designs but I just wish there was more options for the start up pack for the trees and the ambiance music but overall brilliant!,positive
5664,"Love this app, it helps me stay focused. Easy to use and also love seeing my forest!",positive
5665,"I use it a lot and it really helps with my concentration. The timer is slightly slower than actual time though, so if you want to know the exact time you worked for check your clock before and after",positive
5666,I love this app.... It helped me improve my lifestyle.... Nd made me a better more mature version of myself... The only gripe is that plz allow us to whitelist some apps.... Like I know it's there in the premium version but at least allow like two three apps to be whitelisted.... That would help us so much,positive
5667,I really loved it as I studied my plant would grow just the problem was that if I wanted to unlock a package of grow real trees or get knowlage about trees I had to purchase it that is why I have a problem in the app. Well if the app is for studying then why are you have made a purchase deal I don't think this is fair. 😊pls try to get rid of this purchase,positive
5668,"Amazing app! I just wish that non-premium members could have an account so we could save our forests that we've already planted over the years, the trees we bought, and the coins we have/had.",positive
5669,"Love this app so much!! It's helped me so much over Th years to get University work and school work down, but I do wish that trees didn't cost as much :(",positive
5670,"Easy to use, effective and fun. Can't afford the premium though",positive
5671,It's a really good app if you're trying to focus on somethingband it's definitely helping me with my studies for final. The satisfaction after you see that the timers up is awesome and works great if you use the reward system for focusing.,positive
5672,Very innovative concept. It does what it claims to do reasonably well-help you focus. Implementation could be better though. Few very essential features are behind paywall despite the app having ads.,positive
5673,"i really like this app, it helps me focus with my tasks and study, but hope you get rid of the messenger pop ups, i could still get notifications and able to view it without losing a plant. but overall i love it.",positive
5674,It would be much better if there was an option letting you categorize some apps as exceptions . For example I'm studying and then I need to use my dictionary but I can't cause If I want to do it I have to give up which is a bit annoying,positive
5675,Really nice. I just this to get ready in the morning and to focus at work. I've not been late since i started and I'm loving it. I don't like that you can't turn the vibrate off,positive
5676,"Nice app! But almost everything from the menu needs a premium verson to use it. At least keep the friends section as a free section, so people will get other people involved in this.",positive
5677,"Great but latest update has bugs. Despite having enough coins, when I try to purchase the new weeping willow I keep getting an error saying I don't have enough coins.",positive
5678,So far it is good. But however i hate it when it still lags,positive
5679,"great help when you need to stay focused and shouldn't touch your phone 😉 Since the last update, I can't access the shop anymore. It keeps loading and loading...",positive
5680,"Sad that I lost all my progress when I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Also, I always get Error Code 2 when trying to get double coins from viewing the ad.",positive
5681,It's a nice applications but it should also have a button for completing before time. Give up then ends up killing the tree and hence loss of progress of the forest.,positive
5682,"Interesting.... I think... Not yet try. Coming here clicking rate, and unlock a tree.",positive
5683,"Very fun and a good way to stay focused. I do recommend this app. The sounds come broken sometimes, it should be fixed.",positive
5684,Great App But I still need a feature that the app should have a custom notification sound selection option so that I can know that notification has come from this app.,positive
5685,"Its a really good app that has helped to motivate me to revise, i just wish that you could plant real trees without having to purchase forest premium, i also like the design of the app and how easy it is to use",positive
5686,It's a great app. I use it when I'm trying to study and it helped me a lot but whenever I want to search something from Google I can't. Please don't get me wrong. Giving 4 stars,positive
5687,"It's very good but I'm upset I can't open dictionary, calendar, gallery or even listen to. music on mobile. Please check this out. OK for social media but all no 😔",positive
5688,Such an amazing app! Really helps me focus and keep myself on track with my assignments! Only con is buying coins but you can save them up over time!,positive
5689,I love the app and ended up buying pro because I wanted to save my coins to plant a real tree. Why is there no option to watch an advert to double coins on Pro version?,positive
5690,Excellent look and feel. I will change my score to 5 if you add a homescreen widget to observe our forest. Thank you.,positive
5691,This app is very helpful However I had bought this app on my apple device and just recently swapped to android and now if I want the full version of this app i have to re-purchase it to get all the facilities,positive
5692,This app is awesome though it hangs most of tge time after I finish growing a tree. But in overall I love it. And I hope this app will have more features in the future,positive
5693,Really cute app and I love it. But I wish there was a feature where you can pause the timer? Take a short break then resume studying. It'll be really nice,positive
5694,It was better before all the pay for features. I use it while studying and it's very helpful,positive
5695,I like this app. You think that the hours spent in class and the potential to acquire a college degree would be enough... but it is not.. only the idea of growing a virtual forest will keep me off my damn phone.,positive
5696,"I think this app is great, only problem is, it's very easy to close out of the app without the timer stopping and your plant dying.",positive
5697,It really helps me for studying and keeps me in focus. I also likes to grow many trees in my forest so I study by keeping the timer on and at the end I have studied than I thought and many beautiful trees are too grown.,positive
5698,Very helpful for getting things done. I wish there were more white noise options but otherwise very cool,positive
5699,"love it!! so helpful, works really well and is super cute. i just wish the different trees cost less coins",positive
5700,Wonderful app... I am really able to concentrate more now. A must try app for someone who loses focus easily.,positive
5701,its a pretty great app with lots of stuff do.It actually helps.I just love it and use it everyday,positive
5702,I just download this app and it was so cool and helpful. It helps me to stay focus and use my time wisely..,positive
5703,it's good,positive
5704,Beautiful plants,positive
5705,I like that they have incorporated a lot of different plants to choose from💚,positive
5706,"I tried to download this app, but it says not enough space.When I download any other app it installs the app immediately. I don't understand it.",positive
5707,"I wish there was an overnight option. I would also like if there was something to grow on a larger scale. Like wonders of the world from sleepy town. Except it would be geared towards nature. Like growing the Savannah or a swamp or a rainforest. I think it gets old too quickly. ""Okay I grew four trees these past two hours""...again. I think it could be bigger and better. Give me some themes, Give me a world to build.",positive
5708,App is so cute <3,positive
5709,awesome application,positive
5710,Amazing app,positive
5711,So far I am enjoying it,positive
5712,Nice,positive
5713,"Love this app so much!! It's helped me so much over Th years to get University work and school work down, but I do wish that trees didn't cost as much :(",positive
5714,Me gusta Es para quitar el vicio,positive
5715,Nice app but pls include better sounds,positive
5716,Awesome 👍,positive
5717,"Very good app for focus, has helped me on more than one occasion. I will say though, the audio it plays, if you choose to play it, sometimes glitches out on my Galaxy S9. It will sometimes just shut off and refuse to play even when my volume is on and the sound option is on. Otherwise though, its a very good focus app, great for people like me who get easily distracted by their phones.",positive
5718,Amazing app for students😲😲😲,positive
5719,"Nothing is ideal, but this app helped me to write a song and make my own project. It's funny, that same time I grow a beautiful garden. Thanks)",positive
5720,For when I keep touching my phone!,positive
5721,Great app,positive
5722,I love this app a lot but it keeps closing everytime I try to use it after a couple of inactive days. It have to keep uninstalling and installing it. Please fix this problem soon!! I really enjoy this app!,positive
5723,Forest is a gamification of the pomodoro technique. It's more helpful than other pomodoro-type apps. The vibration notification is too long and loud. Otherwise an excellent app.,positive
5724,Good app.Useful for studies.Well done guys.Buddha also taught to love the nature.As buddhist Ial appreciate this,positive
5725,"The app idea is great, but the actual app is kinda slow and a bit confusing to get around. The concept is very simple, yet the user interface is way too complex and has many features that I bet nobody really uses. Less buttons, more trees.",positive
5726,I love this app it really helps me stay focused ...,positive
5727,Good,positive
5728,I love this app. It gives me purpose to keep on focusing. One suggestion: can we have full screen/ zoomed view of the forest??,positive
5729,This app is really usefull but i didn't figure so far how to set the app to wiyher my trees whenever i exit it/ use other apps while planting. I saw a set of instructions but nine were helpful for the Samsung device i posses. I need to say i really except an answer that can help me solve my problem,positive
5730,Upgrades are really hard to afford,positive
5731,Fun way to keep away from your phone!,positive
5732,Very good app to focus,positive
5733,Useful,positive
5734,💖,positive
5735,I love this,positive
5736,希望可以开放一个正向计时的功能就好了,positive
5737,"It's a good app, but has some errors, if a close the app, a can use every app of my phone for example, it will be more fun if one can interactore with the forest play with it or change the form idk.",positive
5738,"Very good app the only thing is that the minimum time is ten minutes and a lot of times I want to concentrate for five minutes. Otherwise, really cute and it works correctly.",positive
5739,Good,positive
5740,Really good.....i cannot believe my eyes ...my eyes😏😂,positive
5741,i am using pro version and its pretty well organised applicatiom among its competitors. but my suggestion is that please make a significant difference in tree for varioua time period. for example most of tree looks same at evry time period,positive
5742,Very useful app helps you stay focused 🙂🙂👍,positive
5743,I think its cute.,positive
5744,Muy buena app. Estoy apunto de comprar la versión plus de lo buena qué es.,positive
5745,Noice,positive
5746,Reall well,positive
5747,I love the white noise feature. It helps me stay focused on the task at hand.,positive
5748,"I love the app! It's a great way to stay focused, especially with all the quarantining going on. However, I have one issue with this app: the ambient noises you can play don't loop properly, and become glitchy if you let them play for too long.",positive
5749,This app is so good,positive
5750,Fantastic,positive
5751,Great app to be focused,positive
5752,nice,positive
5753,"I love the app so I decided to install it again to keep up with school work, it works amazing but my screen is very dark, my phone brightness is all the way up but the app isnt bright but instead very dark. This has never happened before. How do I fix this?",positive
5754,The app keeps crashing whenever i don't use the app for a few days. I have to uninstall and then install again for it to work normally.,positive
5755,My mother was saying your maximum time limit was two hours with the phone.but I always did more. This app allowed me to stay focused on something else really recommend it.,positive
5756,"A beautiful app but.. I would love an option where you dont have to set a time, you just put it on and watch the trees grow as you work and come back to your phone an hour or two hours, whenever youre done! I also found that trees die if I dont come back fast enough after my timer expires? Like if I set my timer for 1 hour and I come back in 2 Ill find the tree died, thats weird, is that a bug on my end? Beautiful app guys, I love it but those things above would have me using it more!",positive
5757,"I like this app and i use it everyday for studying and reaching the amount of time i wanna stay focused on my works that need to be done, everything is great but i really wish there were an option for us to choose the apps that we need during doing our works and tasks,i've study apps and websites i need to use but i can't because of this limit,therefore i won't plant trees, i wish you could give us options about the apps we wanna use and the ones we don't.It's rly a problem. please fix this! Tnx",positive
5758,Decent mate,positive
5759,Good apps but can be add more features,positive
5760,This was a very useful app to make me stop using my gadgets but right now i tried to download it but i can't i think its because my tablet is not android 7 and up can you please support those gadgets if this is the problem? I really want to use it again :),positive
5761,Amazing,positive
5762,helpfull.,positive
5763,This app is so amazing!!!!,positive
5764,it will helo you to stay focused,positive
5765,It really helps me for studying and keeps me in focus. I also likes to grow many trees in my forest so I study by keeping the timer on and at the end I have studied than I thought and many beautiful trees are too grown.,positive
5766,So far it is good. But however i hate it when it still lags,positive
5767,"I love this app so much, I've had it for almost a week and I've only found one bad thing about it. It's absolutely adorable and it's helped me stay off my phone and make it fun to do so. The problem I've had is that when I get video chat requests from Instagram my trees die but I fixed it by muting video chat requests. Overall it's super fun :)",positive
5768,its nice to when u r responsible for ur mistake (off the track ur tree breaks ) gives guilt of wasting time on phone,positive
5769,A great way to keep myself focused. I enjoy the different tree options and seeing the forests i grow every day. Good way to measure my producticity levels too.,positive
5770,Good,positive
5771,"The app is good.. But we can overide this by changing the system time manually to future.. Ideally after turning on the time the app shouldn't hv allowed to change the screen, even to home screen or settings screen.. Then this could have been perfect. But android system may not allow to do so..",positive
5772,It helps me stay focused. Wish you could allow certain apps that you need to use,positive
5773,"I really love the app! But I have one suggestion though, I hope you make the trees animated so users can have a better experience and enjoy their forest more! Nevertheless, this app is 💣",positive
5774,perfect,positive
5775,"After the latest update, the forest has been removed. Coin count and tree purchase history is up-to-date, but the entire forest is gone. Synchronization does not fix the issue. I did not reinstall app as per the in-app warning not to. What the hell? Update: after two weeks issue was fixed",positive
5776,Good app,positive
5777,I love the app so much...It has improved my productivity but recently it has stopped opening..I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but still it isn't working...Please try to resolve the issue at the earliest.,positive
5778,The statistics section needs some work,positive
5779,This is a great app...helps me a lot...but I have 2 problems: 1.the app doesn't give notifications on time when the time is up.....it used to give proper notifications before...but for the past 2 weeks it doesn't sound on time. 2. another problem is that I'm not getting the coins I earned ! Sometimes when the notification doesn't come (as described above) I don't get any coins and the timer resets itself without awarding me my coins. I request you to fix these 2 problems as soon as possible !,positive
5780,"It's relaxing, makes me focused and increased my productivity so well. I just wish that the trees won't cost so much coins. Also, it would be so helpful if the whitelist is also available for free version users, maybe by varying the number of apps allowed in the whitelist to make it still worth buying the premium version. Otherwise it's awesome, thank you for this app!",positive
5781,Good,positive
5782,"Easy to use, effective and fun. Can't afford the premium though",positive
5783,Love it 🎄,positive
5784,Best Pomodoro app. There's only two things that I'd wish they included. 1.) I wish they allowed portrait mode so I can have my phone propped up sideways. 2.) Could you guys please allow this app to take up the WHOLE screen so I don't get distracted by notification icons or the time?,positive
5785,Good,positive
5786,4 zzZ z z zZ Z,positive
5787,😗😛😛,positive
5788,Great experience,positive
5789,"the app is good but in the over view section , even though i have focused for 45 minutes or some hour straight , it always show the data as 2 different phases. example-》45minutes=21minute then 24 minute.",positive
5790,"The app concept is so great.It drives people to work on.but there is an issue when i try to remove withered trees.I click on watch ad to remove,then it opens an ad but suddenly disappears the ad and it doesn't remove my wethered trees.",positive
5791,"Great idea, but missing something and feels incomplete.",positive
5792,"Really helpful app, but there's one problem. You can leave the app by clicking the home button and your tree keeps growing while you do other stuff on your phone, which means it doesn't really prevent you from leaving the app. Hope this is fixed because I really like this!",positive
5793,This app is amazing to help me focus and study and do assignments. I have brought the pro version but it wouldn't allow me to sync the trees I have planted on my laptop to my phone. It would be amazing if they could fix it!,positive
5794,Helps me to stay focused,positive
5795,good design. hope the plant real trees is a true story!,positive
5796,"Good at keeping me focused,",positive
5797,Good,positive
5798,Cute,positive
5799,"This app is cute and a great option to just setting a timer when working/studying. However, several times I have gotten a wilted tree just because some other app sent me notifications when I myself did not touch my phone. :(",positive
5800,Amazing I love how it has a game element to it. When I use it to keep me focused and of my phone it is a real help and I get all my school work done on time! I can also get excited when I have enough coins to buy a new plant!! I am saving up for the dog one. If anyone is in need of something to get them of their phone so they can concentrate on school I'd reccomend this app!!😊😊😁 from Amber,positive
5801,"Overall, it's pretty fantastic. Planting flowers and trees - and not wanting them to die - is good motivation to Accomplish Things without the phone. Sometimes there's an issue with notifications cancelling the timer, but that doesn't happen as often anymore. Looking forward to seeing what new plants show up in the app next! And the customer support team are great about replying if you have issues transitioning to a new phone.",positive
5802,"Very good app! It is really soothing and motivating to see trees growing in my forest, and there is a suprising variety of plants. The free version is already awesome, but the cheap premium version is even better. Planting real trees sound magnificent and the white list function is very important to me. Suprisingly, no disruptive ads are found in both versions. Definitely recommend it!",positive
5803,"It really works!!.. I tried other apps like those that keep the phone locked. But ended up unlocking it more often,as a challenge. This one instead had my phone unlocked but it was nice to see the saplings bloom.. And whenever I peeked a look there was message like ""don't look here"" or ""focus"" as if I was being watched.. So it kept me from using the phone and I was able to concentrate. Really liked the app... Highly recommended.. Would recommend to all. 😁",positive
5804,This app is really good because i dont get distacted as much bc i dont want my plant to die so i stay off my phone. It also helps as i want to unlock more plants so i stay on the apo longer (work longer) to earn more coins to get more plant. Would recomend if you find your self on tik tok or social media when you are suppose to be working/doing school. This is really helping out this quartine Thanks!,positive
5805,"This is an amazing app, it has helped me focus so much and even has a real world impact, but only if you use pro version. I completely understand the need for a pro version, without it you wouldn't be able to do the things you do with the app, and I wish it wasn't there, but that's not my call to make. It's an amazing app and I highly recommend",positive
5806,This app is great for staying on task. The interface allows you to leave and access your documents while still allowing you to have your focus timer on. This app is so Awesome!! I genuinely love this app. I hope that more people would download and experience its greatness.,positive
5807,Amazing . It really helps to focus on important tasks rather than wasting time on useless apps . A huge plus ( in my opinion ) is the fact that when you upgrade to PRO you can plant real trees only using coins you've collected in the game .,positive
5808,"I really love the app, I use it a lot while studying but it doesn't notify me when the time's up. I installed it twice and I followed the instructions about notification access and stuff but it still doesn't work. I also have the last version of the app so I don't think that's the problem. What can I do? Update: seems to work now! Thanks!",positive
5809,"This app really helps me even if I'm not studying or hanging out with friends! I like that you have too set a time for how long you want to do things, but I wish that if you wanted to leave the end the time you would have a withered tree in your forest. Other then that, I think the app is awesome!",positive
5810,"This app is so simple yet effective. I've been using it on and off for five years now, and I always seem to come back to it when I really need to focus. There are a couple of hiccups with the app but I've still given it five stars as these don't really take away from how great it is.",positive
5811,I absolutely love this app. It definitely helps me stay on track with my all of my home school home work due the COVID 19. It helps me stay off other apps because I definitely dont want my tree to die. Overall this is my new most important app because of me being such a procrastinator. I surely recommend for people like me who easily get of track a lot.,positive
5812,"Love it. Great app to get off your phone. Please extend optional time of focus past 3hrs, create more trees and plants in the future, as well as allow users to plant more than 5 real trees. Great app! Just some helpful suggestions from someone who loves it!",positive
5813,I love this app but the only problem is that I am not able to buy trees at all. When I click on th tree I want to purchase there is a pop up saying that the app crashed Added later : I did that before but it did not work and now I have 2531 seeds and it's kinda nice to look at all the seeds and now I am satisfied with my 3 plants. Thisappissuitableformytabletplaystoresaidthat'swhyit'snotworkingformebutihaveuseditinmydadsphineandworksamazinglyirecommenditforsureiamwritingwithoutspacecozofwordlimi,positive
5814,"I have been in and out of this app many a times. It was all my fluctuating mind, not the app. The app is super special. I bought the pro version this time and opt to stick to it forever. Best wishes for the developers♥️.",positive
5815,Great app! I joined a group chat and we all work together at the same time! It's a lot more motivating than studying alone. I love the idea that we can help plant real tress too! What an excellent cause! I love the idea of painting a virtual forest too!,positive
5816,"It is a great app. The only problem i have is the fact that there is no option for an specific time (like for example 36 minutes, etc) that would make this app immensely better",positive
5817,"This is honestly the best app to help stay focused. You can choose the amount of time you want to study or do homework for, and it honestly works. You feel the need to let the tree grow. I 100% recommend this to anyone who wants to stay focused.",positive
5818,Great app for doing work. It will keep you focused and it really works. Just try it if you dont believe. Great work team. You guys created a marvelous app which worth 5/5.,positive
5819,"I love the concept of this app. As a nature lover, I think it's perfect for me. It allows me to remain motivated and focused on my studies, and knowing that one can plant real trees a while after using this app warms my heart! Great work.",positive
5820,Forest is such a great App to help you focus and motivate you to concentrate and stay off your phone! I'm currently saving up to spend my coins for a real tree! :) I love that concept so so much!,positive
5821,"Perfect app, has really helped me focus on college work or even getting off my phone for a break. Only thing I could ask for would be more options for the sounds/ambiance tab.",positive
5822,"Great app for revising and studying, it really helps you to stay focused 😁 growing trees to keep you focused is a lovely concept and I love the sounds you can play in the background",positive
5823,Very motivation app. It encourages you to grow more and more tree. I was looking for this kind of app from long time. Before I used to skip a day but now I would love to grow at a least a tree in my forest(app). With help of this forest I can study. Thanks,positive
5824,This app definitely helps me to be more focused when studying and making sure that you aren't on your phone. I also think it's a great concept to make your own Forest by doing so.,positive
5825,This is the best app ever!.... it helps me manage my time when im doing my online homework and not get distracted!! I tend to procrastinate a lot of times so i know for a fact this app is the best,positive
5826,This app is so cool! It really helps me to motivate my self and I love the sounds it does in the background! Highly reccomend!,positive
5827,Love it! Very simple clean interface and satisfying sounds and colors make this app soothing and beneficial to (not) use!,positive
5828,"Very good app and it's very calming really helps me learn how to let go, and spend less time on my phone.",positive
5829,"Great app. Keeps statistics of your day, month and year in a compact form.",positive
5830,"I found this app to be pretty useful. Whenever I need to get something done, I go onto this app, and plant a tree or bush. I recommended this to a few of my friends, and they're enjoying it too!",positive
5831,"Love this app to stay off my phone while working, it really helps in only using the phone if it's really necessary. It's super motivating to watch your forest grow",positive
5832,"Forest is cute, unobtrusive, and has genuinely helped me in the transition from checking my phone to doing work. A neat option is the ability to allow certain apps (eg, Spotify to change music)",positive
5833,"I really enjoy this app! It's a fun, satisfying way to keep track of time (and stay off my phone for a while!)",positive
5834,Great app! Just having it on your home screen helps you stay focused because you want to use it every time you see it.,positive
5835,"Great app for staying focused, good way to track your time spent working in a more fun and engaging way",positive
5836,"I've tried plenty of pomodoro-esque apps and this one is the standout. Planting trees actually keeps me interested in focusing longer without distracting me from my work. I bought the premium upgrade months ago and haven't looked back. My one suggestion would be to work in break times. Typical pomodoro is work 25 mins, break for 5, work again, etc. Maybe have a popup asking if I want a 5 min break every 25 mins, a popup that can easily be ignored if I want to continue working instead.",positive
5837,"Love it! Gotten through a bunch of essays with this app. I love it actually let's your phone play music, which I always turn on before starting the timer. I do have one complaint, and it is a small one though- I think there should be breaks during the timer. I've needed to use the restroom a lot during studies, and I feel guilty because I'm wasting time. So I think there should be a 5 minutes break option. Maybe you're only allowed to use it once or twice per tree, depending on the time it took",positive
5838,"I have used this app before and it's really awesome, it helps me with giving a challenge for focusing on my work and studies for the time I desire. I enjoy growing trees and creating a forest while studying. This app is the best for focusing , with its whitelist feature I can even listen to music or talk to someone without destroying my tree. I love this app, thank you for this.",positive
5839,"Everytime that I finished a session it freezes. I sent you a feedback with the system log. Please try to fix the issue otherwise, it's a great app that keeps you focused but please do it ASAP. UPDATE: I've updated Forest but still the same issue. See Feedback with System Logs Jan 5th, 2020: No issues for the moment Update 1.5: Working fine back to 5 stars",positive
5840,"This works like a Pomodoro style of focusing. But with a little fun thing, very nice.",positive
5841,This is great for studying. It's a fun insensive to turn your phone off! It has really helped with online school in isolation.,positive
5842,"the app is great and i honestly love it, until recently. now when i want to plant a tree, the app stops, unless i'm connected to the internet. also when i successfully plant a tree while using the app offline, the tree doesn't save and the app stops. please fix this as soon as possible and i will rate this 5 stars!!! edit: wow, after the new update the app doesn't stop, but you can't plant a tree, online nor offline. congrats. edit: it's fixed!!",positive
5843,"I am very bad at just starting something and staying with it for a decent amount of time, or at least enough to get it done. This really really helps me in that aspect because I can set reminders, I got the fancy version, that will ping at me whenever I want them to to tell me to work on stuff. Also, every time I look at my little baby tree growing, I kno ""okay I just have this much longer and then I can take a break"" and honestly that is helping me. It is very cute, and user-friendly. 10 / 10",positive
5844,Easy to use and works seamlessly. It has helped me stay on track with my studies and even to take breaks timely breaks. The incentives are fun and interesting enough to keep me wanting to plant trees. I particularly enjoy labelling the trees as I can then export the data and see how many hours I have been working on different things. It gives me the freedom to write up my own things in python to analyse that data and plan better for the next week.,positive
5845,"Simple to use, feels like I'm ""doing something"" by planting a tree and setting my phone down. I've gotten my 5-year-old to sit still and watch the plant ""grow"" for over 20 minutes... We like saving enough coins to plant real trees! The new limited edition trees are exciting to watch for and try to earn, but it's nice that you can buy them later too. Pretty art, fun app, AND plants real trees!? I love this app.",positive
5846,"I love Forest! It was the first app in which I paid for the premium version, and it was so worth it! It is very cute, motivational, and easy to use. The only suggestion I have for future updates is for the user to be able to customize plant placement. Thank you Forest developers! Update: I have been using Forest for about 6 months now and still love it. I just want to say how much I appreciate the Forest team listening to feedback and providing amazing customer support. Thank you!",positive
5847,"An excellent app for everyone who struggles focusing on anything. Planting trees and preventing them from dying, then having a whole, beautiful forest is motivating. There's a global ranking refreshing each week, so you can compete with other players. You may even plant with your friends if you want. There are multiple tree species, updated quite often which makes the game just more exciting. I found paying for the premium version worth it.",positive
5848,"Helped me stay focused! Usually when I study I always have my phone around and i keep getting distracted by my phone(twitter, yt etc.) i have an upcoming exam this week and I decided to stay focus so I downloaded this app! Its great and it really works! The first time i tried to give up i was so sad to kill a tree so i try to focus! I really recommend this app especially for my fellow students! (also excuse my grammar because english is not my first language :)) )",positive
5849,"Recommended this by two work friends to help keep focused as we read long sometimes boring documents - works so great! I feel really motivated to keep reading and stay off my phone. Even for things the app doesn't track (like not chatting to co-workers) I feel more guilty/conscious of concentrating when the app is running and growing my tree, so I have cut down on chat with coworkers and stuff too.",positive
5850,This app really helps me when working on school at home.(We've been doing a lot of that bc of COVID-19) I really suggest this app! Hint: if you want a free tree from the store order them from least coins to greatest,positive
5851,"Really nice and relaxing app, I like the relaxing forest noises that play while the tree is growing))",positive
5852,Super helpful app! I get so invested in making sure my plants don't die and it really helps,positive
5853,I love how I can keep track how long I focus and on what. It's also really rewarding to see your forest grow,positive
5854,"Really helpful for making me stay focused on studying, I think the guilt of killing a plant is very motivational. However there was a weird bug, during finals week I was using this app for hours straight but then it suddenly stopped working. When I click the plant button, nothing happens. I left it alone for awhile and its okay now but I wonder why it happened. I also really like the store and think its very motivational.",positive
5855,"I love this app! It helps me to stay focused on my work or whatever other tasks I've set for myself, and helps me track time on those tasks. I like the whitelist feature so that I can use apps on my phone that are necessary for work while growing a tree. And I love plants! So keeping them alive is a real incentive. Thank you for creating it!",positive
5856,"Love this app!! It helps to keep me focused while studying. You get really invested in planting your trees and seeing them live, which is a good deterrent from checking social media and texts. I enjoy how you can work towards new types of plants and get some variety in your forest. I definitely recommend to anyone looking for a little push with no (real) consequences to stay focused.",positive
5857,"It's silly to think that something so simple helps me to focus, but so it is! The ritual of planting a tree and then not doing anything else until it's finished growing has been very beneficial for my self-motivated work. And I love looking back on my forest to see a visual representation of my hard work.",positive
5858,This is just great!! I saw my favorite youtuber using this and I was like what the hell is she using that enables you so much facilities like you are bound6to stay focused. I literally searched for the name of this app and I finally found it. I am using it for 1 month now and it's the best..!!! ❤ but sometimes it just don't notifies me when the time is over and sometimes just keeps counting the time even when I m watching YouTube or instagram on my phone.,positive
5859,"Great incentive/nudge to be present during the activity/practice of your choice. A gentle way to reinforce mindful habits. If I know my tree is going to die because of lack of time or focus, I either clear more time if possible, schedule the task for a more appropriate time-slot or take a few deep breaths to center to why I chose to do this or is this something I really want to do in the first place. It's like a little promise to yourself before diving in.",positive
5860,"Cute app that helps me stay focused. It's customizability makes it really great, so I can tell it what apps are and aren't okay for me to use. Like if I'm doing work and I NEED to check my email for something related to what I'm doing, I can take my email app off of the black list Also it's kinda nice to plant a real tree every once and a while the focus rewards. If you're struggling to tame your time on your phone during times you should be focusing, the free version is worth a try.",positive
5861,"This app is wonderful, but I am having problems with the things linking to the network. I have a good internet and have tried restarting the app several times, however I can't seem to connect to the shop for my in game currency and the real forest things. It says unable to connect, I'm just saying this in case, I'll check with support",positive
5862,I love this app. I really struggle to concentrate when I have a pile of papers to mark or some other boring stack of work and Forest helps me to stay off my phone for reasonable stretches of time. Like I really care about my virtual forest and don't want to kill any trees so scrolling insta is just not worth it.,positive
5863,"This app has been helping me maintain As in all of my classes! I have ADHD so I find it hard to stay focused, but this app has been a lifesaver. I hope to see more achievements added in the future. Thank you forest team for making an app that actually helps people on a daily basis! You guys rock!",positive
5864,"Thus far, I'm enjoying this app. I feel absolutely motivated in completing a task; and, staying on track. Even, when I feel like getting off track, I'm reminded of the growth that's manifesting between my tree and myself. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for the best app ever. Looking forward to additional features!",positive
5865,"Awesome app! Used it before, but downloaded again to help me focus while studying at home during social distancing.",positive
5866,"This app has greatly helped me in creating better study habits and eliminating procrastination (I'm a high school senior for reference). Part of the reason is because, rather than simply completely blocking usage of apps, it allows you to choose to break your streak, forcing you to actually consider the consequences of procrastinating. My only gripe is that I feel like the ability to whitelist apps should be free (although it is only around $3, which isn't bad). I'd recommend it to anyone.",positive
5867,"Simple to use, and surprisingly motivational. Graphics are cute, and though I don't use the music due to hearing loss, there's a good selection. Love the tracking feature, enabling you to SEE your focus-time for the day, week, month, etc.",positive
5868,"Got this when I realized I got most distracted from my work by looking at my phone. Really helps me focus when I need to. I didn't want one of those apps that completely locks down your phone in case I actually needed to use it for something important, but I don't want to kill my trees for unimportant stuff. Also I like that they have a variety of trees that you have to work to get. It makes me more motivated to use the app. I hope they add more season-themed trees (snow covered would be cool!)",positive
5869,"I really love this app, I love challenging myself as I have a very bad phone habit and will lose hours staring at my phone. Devs, my trees die when an alarm goes off on my phone - super frustrating when I'm just picking it up to turn the alarm off. Maybe that can be an exception?",positive
5870,"it's a wonderful app to help you focus more on your work or studies. you can select a time of how long you want to focus (you can choose from 10m to 2h) while doing that you also have a wide range of options available of all kinds of trees and bushes! the more time you select the more coins you get rewarded and with those coins you can buy new trees or bushes. i have bought the premium version for €1,99 which isn't much at all and because i have it i can personalise the app blacklist!",positive
5871,It's honestly very useful when studying or working by myself. It keeps me accountable for how much work I get done. Whenever I'm working and I don't like what I'm doing or it's hard or I cant focus or whatever I always try to distract myself from my phone so this is helpful. 10/10. Also the little trees are cute. I like to do a lot of short times so I can build up a forest instead of just one big tree,positive
5872,This app is too good it is helping me and futher it will to be staying focused at a particular thing for a particular period of time,positive
5873,A really cute app! Great for keeping track of your focus.,positive
5874,"I have been using this app for years. I get really hooked on committing to longer focus times just to unlock the full potential of the trees offered (there are different aspects to the tree with different amounts of study time, ie less than 60mins, greater than 60mins, and a special one for 2 hours of focus, plus bushes). As someone with ADHD (and OCD, which may explain my obsession with this app), studying wouldn't be the same without Forest! 🌲",positive
5875,"I actually use this app for practicing flute and it helps so much. I have tried using normal timers but i usually end up and just pause it saying ill come back later and never do it but with this i can set a timer and it keeps me off my other phone apps and keeps me seated since i cant really pause the timer. And its also really nice to see my progress throughout the week for practicing with all the trees that ive planted. Overall really nice app, i highly recommend it!!!",positive
5876,I love this app. The pro version helps me stay focused no matter where I go :),positive
5877,"This app is literally saving my grades! Just an idea for a different way of using, maybe add an option where you put your phone down and it just plants a randon tree and when you pick your phone back up you can see what tree is planted or how many you got? Its just sometimes i need to focus but i dont know how long for and then i either kill the tree or feel i could have planted for longer with more coins?",positive
5878,"Love it! This app has really helped me stay focused on my school work, and I feel really good that my points are going towards planting a real tree. The rate of reward is low enough to make it a challenge, but high enough to make it satisfying. Very cool, especially for a free app.",positive
5879,"I couldn't open the app after I installed it. Reinstalled game, tried again and still doesn't work. Edit: Thank you for fixing the problem I re-downloaded the app and it works perfectly. It's very fun to pass time with this app and I'm also really happy that you can listen to music on this app too while watching the tree(s) grow.",positive
5880,"The app is amazing. One feature or suggestion I would like to suggest would be to start planting a tree at some given time as set by the user everyday and restrict the user from using other apps opened at the same time and if he still uses other apps he would hv to wither the tree. 😊 Otherwise, kudos to your team. You people are doing amazing. Loving it totally ❤️",positive
5881,I enjoyed using this app to stay focus. The sense of achievement for getting the trees planted keeps me motivated.,positive
5882,I've used this app multiple times over the years. It helps me stay away from my phone so that I can get tasks done. My love for a virtual tree far out weighs my urges to check social media and my blog. My grades in college and the cleanliness of my home thanks this app.,positive
5883,"The app works once and the second time i try to open it, it just refuses to open! I have redownloaded the app many times but this problem continues. Other than that, I really enjoy this app. Edit: I have sent the problems on the said email. Edit: they did respond and the app works fine now :) excellent customer service!",positive
5884,"I like the app because it's just as it is described. It is very easy to adjust times for focus, tree species to plant, and the motivational messages that are showed keep me going forward. I don't the fact that the trees and music are both too expensive. other than that, not really any challenge",positive
5885,"This app has really helped me focus on my school work. As times are now with the e learning situation, it's done wonders for me!",positive
5886,"Fantastic app, it helped me develop a good study habit of remaining focussed and taking positive breaks in moderation.",positive
5887,"Great for productivity if you use it right. You really need to respect the timer if you want it to actually work. 4 stars because I'd like to see room breaks implemente, since right now you have to do your own break and restart the room.",positive
5888,"Initially I thought this would be another app I get and forget about in a week. Not at all, this app is working great for me. I started planning and recording everything. It is keeping me accountable for my focus. It may sound stupid but it is fantastic.",positive
5889,I love it! Keeps me focused and the store items are so cue,positive
5890,A simple app to help you put the phone down and feel accomplished!,positive
5891,Nice app and good for my focus skills And it also helps me to build my focus skills. I am very happy about that because I love this it will allow you to stay focused on your work instead of checking your phone after every interval of time. I appreciate the people downloading the app you should download this app surely.,positive
5892,This game is a great way to get things done. I love the idea of not being able o leave the app or your tree will die. I consider this a great tool as I am homeschooled.,positive
5893,"Simple, yet effective. Pro version is cheap and awesome:)",positive
5894,Great app! It really helped me to be productive throughout the day!,positive
5895,"Great app using the pomodoro technique for focusing on missions. The only thing I feel could be improved is allowing certain app to work (using setting) Fir example I take online coarses on my phone, and it would have been appreciated if the app wasn't considered to kill the tree",positive
5896,Its AWESOME 1) download it to manage time 2) time hw 3) stay on track with every day activities 4) easy tolook back on *ORGANIZED* time plots to help manage day to day activities! It's easy to use and is organized with minimal work (you can also use time coins to plant real trees),positive
5897,"This app has helped me stay off my phone at work. Instead of randomly looking at my phone and getting distracted, I will plant a tree to grow for an hour and when the hour is over I look at my phone for 5 minutes then plant another tree. I get so much more work done because I have a reason to not get distracted.",positive
5898,"Ever since the update to at a Whitelist to allow me to use my phone apps such as Google Docs , Notepad, Duolingo, etc. It's been a lot more wonderful of an experience as someone who doesn't always have access to a laptop/computer for homework. Love planting real trees but I do love the updates that come with more variety of our own forests so that I can have weekly themes. Can't wait to see more flowers as well, my suggestion is a colorful bunch of Lilies! Honeysuckles would be adorable too.",positive
5899,"This app is awesome I get distracted so easily, but once I set a timer I stay focused. I will try and reach my phone when my homework gets hard but then the plant growing reminded me to get back to work, afterwards you feel proud! I recomend this for teen students or procrastinators.",positive
5900,Honestly great for helping me focus while working from home. I use it to stop myself from binging news and to manage time using pomodoro method,positive
5901,"The app is totally spectacular, the best of them all.",positive
5902,Great app,positive
5903,Good app for Students,positive
5904,"This is truley an amazing app. It helps me study, clean, and workout without being tempted to get on my phone. I suggest silencing your phone while using this app so you arent tempted to kill your tree. Thank you for this app and keep up the good work!!",positive
5905,"I recommend this app to all of my friends for studying! In addition to the focus help, it motivates me to get more done and to challenge myself in new ways! I especially like seeing a whole forest for a day, month, etc. Sadly, there was no way to transfer my plants when I got a new phone, so I am having to unlock plants again.",positive
5906,Love making tge earth green,positive
5907,My only complaint was that I purchased the app thinking that I could always use the in app currency to plant real world trees. It only allows you to plant 5 but otherwise it's a useful app.,positive
5908,This is an amazing app that helps the environment and helps you stay off your phone. So really its a win win,positive
5909,Its great,positive
5910,Perfect,positive

5921,I love this app so much. Very helpful for someone with ADHD.,positive
5922,It's very good,positive
5923,"UPDATE: changed to 5 stars due to the price changes in the store. The pop up ads are still a little annoying but it's still not too much of q problem. I love the variety in plants you can buy! It's a really cute app. Occasionally an ad would pop up outta nowhere but it's not too much of a problem. I think it'd be nice for the bushes to cost lower than the trees, due to them not needing as much time off to grow, but that's just my opinion. 😊",positive
5924,It is a great app for focusing on something with no distractions. Definitely recommended. 👌👌👌,positive
5925,Phenomenal,positive
5926,Super,positive
5927,"This game is so great it helps you to focus in planting your tree you can invite friends to plant trees and chat to them, actually this is not a game it is simple and educational. Pls download this game to save our environment. Go forest go!!!!",positive

5929,Its awesome time management base app,positive
5930,Its a good app . I liked its all features,positive
5931,Works great!! Keeps me focused and off my phone!! I've tried many different apps like this before and deleted them because they didn't work how I wanted to or they put ads on my homescreen. But this is app doesn't do that and this is the best one around for sure!:),positive

5949,Helps me to focus and its fun to grow the forest. Once I started I found that my studying and sleep has gotten better,positive
5950,This is a great app. I love gardening and this app also explained me about different plants and also has a timer👏,positive
5951,I love. It's fun. And also it makes me want to focus more. That's a pity I can't buy the premium version. Because my country is under sanctions.,positive
5952,"You receive satisfying rewards for staying off your phone, building positive reinforcement for off-screen time. It has an adjustable time scale which corresponds to the reward you receive, so it can be as convinient as you desire. I love it, it has really helped me so much with getting past hard work deadlines, and just focusing on certain tasks in general. 11/6 much recommended👍",positive
5953,One of the best app to stay focused on your study. 😊😊,positive
5954,Its a good app for focusing in studies,positive
5955,Awesome app.... really helpful in increasing concentration.... soothing music helps you ignore all disturbances......your tree dies if you use any other app....so your phone is also no longer a disturbance.....This app is really good for doing deep work.,positive
5956,This app is amazing!! It helps me stay focused on my tasks and definitely away from my phone! Love it and highly recommend,positive
5957,"Useful motivator to avoid phone usage, even on the free version. Very helpful.",positive
5958,"Very simple, good for keeping you away from your phone. Also planting trees is the best for the environment because plants keep animals alive and animals keep plants going by herbivores eating plants then pooping out seeds and predators keep herbivores in check so they don't eat to many plants, it's a symbiotic relationship. Keep this up",positive
5959,So helpful! Been struggling to concentrate during the pandemic but this has actually managed to make me focus on assignments. Definitely considering an upgrade to premium,positive
5960,Good,positive
5961,"This app is so simple yet effective. I've been using it on and off for five years now, and I always seem to come back to it when I really need to focus. There are a couple of hiccups with the app but I've still given it five stars as these don't really take away from how great it is.",positive

6000,"I just bought premium and realized I made a mistake right away! It told me to register to sync my data and I did. Sync option wouldn't do anything. I wasn't able to set a username because of some unknown error all the time. Then half the screen was empty and I decided it was a glitch and reinstalled it and now ALL MY DATA IS GONE! So stupid! I just paid 10 bucks to be able to create more than 5 habits and I lost everything! Don't recommend this app, so disappointed...",negative
6001,NOBODY USE THIS APP. Read all the forums. The app does not support the sync once you've bought premium. Everyone's saying the same. And the devs DO NOT RESPOND TO HELP REQUESTS. I have an error that makes me unable to sync due to a connection error though clearly I am connected to the internet. I am a premium user. The app is great but please help me with my problem. I'm tired of taking screenshots of all my pages every week as my remedy for the sync error.,negative
6002,"Update 2020: sadly they didn't reach out to me despite me paying for premium version. Lost my account and no means of logging back in. Otherwise, the app is good especially the UI. Like this app but until recently I had to change phones and the database could not locate my email and the app changed names and logo so it's all confusing. If you could help me locate my account as I bought the premium version but couldnt log in to my account. Please help because I want to use this great app!",negative
6003,"App was good in past but not anymore, it has stopped sync and many bugs creeped in due to no maintenance and update since. As per details in app Page, last update was on 28th Jun 2018, but still it is the first thing that comes in results when I search for ""Habit"" 😲 I guess Google should stop advertising an app that is not managed since years.",negative

A de/reinstall has now lost all my data and looking at other users with this issue, it looks like it is lost forever because of the sync function never working and no contact from developers. Very upset and disappointed.",negative
6007,"Updating my previous review. I recently hit the two year mark on one of my habits, yet the app only shows me of having 30 days. This is the same bug I reported last year. It appears that it does not recognize some of my habits over the New Year. I've reported this problem four times now and have never heard back from anyone. I'm giving up on this app, and suggest you do too. ""I've used this for a couple of years. There was a bug where one week of my tracking wasn't recognized by the app. This happened the week of New Years. I reached out to the developer five times about it and never heard back. Unfortunately, this has become an unreliable app for tracking.""",negative
6008,"Update: dropped 5 star rating to 1star. App will not sync. I have it on Android and iPad,and neither one of them will sync to the server. App store shows 8 months since any updates. Would not have paid for premium if I knew it wasn't going to be maintained. Original review: I wanted to make something like this myself, but they've already done a great job. I feel more obligated to the daily habits I'm trying to build, and it's great that it tracks my completion streaks.",negative
6009,"I paid for habitbull premium for the sync functionality, which fully does not work. I've tried reinstalling the app, reinstalling android, getting a new phone. No luck. Emailed habitbull a month ago and still no reply. If I want to take a backup I have to screenshot everything. not ideal Apart from this the app is decent. It's got a cute meme",negative
6010,Paid for premium. Sync does not work. Publisher does not reply. Started reading reviews and found numerous people with the same problem. Going to try to get my money back. Nice app if you don't care about backups or syncing between devices or customer support. Switched to Goalify and finding them extremely responsive,negative
6011,"I have been using the app from the last 3 years. I am a premium user. When trying to sign in a new device and sync, it's not syncing. I need my data. please help with this issue. Even after reaching to the support team tonnes of times no one is responding. So i am changing the rating from 3 to 1.",negative
6012,"The idea behind the app is good. Although, after paying for premium, the promised cloud sync does not work (several users mention the same issue). There is no way of backup the data either. I cannot see any feedback from devs here. Switched to a different app: ""Habits.""",negative
6013,"Decent, but premium features like Sync do not work, can't even reimport data you exported yourself. Had I realized this I would have never have bought the app, it's just false advertising. I now have to figure out how to port my data to another app where it won't be inevitably lost.",negative
6014,"Paid for the premium app last year, now there is no history of my email address ever being registered despite me having the confirmation emails from them when I first paid for it. Lots of complaints on here. Get one of the open source habit trackers & back it up yourself to cloud storage rather than spending money with devs who change the app name slightly & try to charge again. Seen this happen so many times.",negative

6018,"Had accumulated 5 habits that lasted 17 days and counting (now using a different app.) This pathetic app that I paid premium for, would not sync. ""Check internet connection"" every damn time. I paid for the damn app, sadly probably past my refund day!",negative
6019,"DO NOT PURCHASE! The app works as it's supposed to, with exception for the added purchase features. I bought the app so it could sync up with multiple devices, that feature does not work despite following the FAQ as to why it might not work. I have tried their support ticket system which had an automated response, but they have yet to respond despite me trying multiple times to reach them and ask for assistance or a refund.",negative
6020,The app hasn't synced for nearly 9 months despite being a premium user. The support team haven't acknowledged my email. It's a good concept but they've failed to make it work and don't provide customer support. Check other reviews. Go to play.google.store on a web browser. Select My Account and go to order history. Select the ... and it offers you an option to request a refund. That should get the developer to either repair it or take off the premium services it is falsely selling.,negative
6021,"Sync DOES NOT work! I've tried multiple times to get it to work and my internet connection is just fine. Had to switch phones when my old phone died and can't get my old data back on the app because sync doesn't work. Also no way to import data. Great app if the feature worked or could import data, but rendered useless because of this. So if I switch phones or have to reset to factory standards, I lose everything. Paid quite a bit for this app just for this feature alone, but it DOES NOT work.",negative
6022,"The app itself gets the job done, but it will not sync and the developer is not responsive to questions. Don't waste your money with premium. You won't get what you pay for.",negative
6023,"The widget and sync functions does not work on premium. I get the widget error telling me to log in but I already have and even reinstalled the app. Nothing works. Developer, please fix this.",negative

I have an open support case that nobody at Habitbull has responded to (#900271) Do not trust this app or whether it will backup your habit tracking data. Terrible customer service and fail of an app.",negative
6025,Hyper masculine tone is very off-putting and irritating. Hint to developers: Women try to change habits too! At least give us the option of just having hints in our own words...,negative
6026,After installing this app my phone received an increased amount of spam calls. After removing the app from my phone I received fewer spam calls. It might be a coincidence... But it might not be.,negative
6027,"Pathetic. I was totally in love with this app until I changed my phone. I lost the phone, and when I installed the app in my new phone, everything was gone. My habits, data for last one year, every damn thing. And I have purchased premium of the highest cost. There's no way to restore my data or contact the devs. If you cannot save on JSON file of mine in your cloud, please explain why I should buy premium?

After setting it up on my phone, which was easy but took some time,when I tried logging onto my son's phone it didn't recognize the account. I contacted customer service but didn't hear back. It's a nice app, really like the features, so this was really disappointing. I could set it up again on his phone but without me being able to monitor on my phone it's not helpful. I still hope someone can help me fix this or I should get a refund for my purchase.",negative

Will give higher star review when these are fixed..",negative

It's buggy, doesn't sync well at all across devices, the UI is very cluttered, the forum needs serious updating, a search tool for eg.

I have set times for reminders throughout the day, but the app sends me random notifications (reminders) when I don't want them. And on other days, no notifications at all. No app updates from the developer in over a year either.",negative

6231,I love the ease of the application and the setup. I don't like that the way they send you reminders that are sometimes rude or shame-based. it doesn't make me want to try any harder when I get scolded for not fulfilling my goals. positive encouragement as the best way.,negative
6232,"I love that you can chose x amount of days a week to complete a habit, other apps force you to commit to specific days, the flexibility in this app helps me succeed, what I hate about this app is it fails to get my habit completion-for example I did my workout for the day but still receive repeated notices to do said workout for that day. way to drain any joy out of an accomplishment habitbull!",negative

This is overly cumbersome over time and is going to cause me to stop using the app because I don't want to have to check everything that DIDN'T happen.

So unless you memorize that goal #7 is say exercise daily, you won't even know what you're looking at. Additionally, the streaks are glitchy as hell, and often times do not calculate correctly. Really wish they also had aggregate goals, for example grouping similar goals together and then tracking the success percent for the aggregate. Like say if you have multiple diet goals for no dairy, no gluten, and no sugar, it would be great to group those in the diet category and then see your success there overall and trending graphs. And come on, add some pie charts and the ability to look at graphs in intervals aside from a single month.",neutral

Or, if you intentionally stopped a habit for a time period, but didn't inactivate it during your chosen time off, your percentage is dragged down.",neutral

6667,I really like this application. Very well done!  My reason for 3 and  not 5stars is the lack of any security. No option for fingerprint or pin before viewing what could be sensitive personal information.  PLEASE ADD SECURITY!,neutral
6668,Good app but faulty notifications. The notifications and reminders were working perfectly but they only work now if I open the app. By that point it's too late. I need the reminders to work to be effective. I purchased the full version.,neutral
6669,"Dont buy the premium, the widgets don't work (the reason I bought premium) and I set up notifications for each hour to remind me of a task, but the notifications only pop up if you open the app which render the notifications useless. Otherwise I enjoy the basic use of the app",neutral

6674,good,neutral
6675,it’s a great app and works great. helps me keep track of whether or not I took pills or did excercises or not. However it lacks the feature of ”multiple times a day” So if for instance a person was trying to create a habit to do something twice in one day. this app won't help since you can only click that you did it once. Does anybody know if thier is an app that has this feature?,neutral
6676,I bought the paid verison. It does help us track the habits with simple yes or no questions and by answering with numbers. But habits aren't as simple as it is... we need other methods to track habits like options to enter time. If I want to develop a habit of waking up by 7.. it shouldn't be a yes or no question... I should be able to enter the time track it over the month.,neutral

6678,Good,neutral
6679,"The best app around for tracking habits. But the artificial limitation to 5 habits in the free version coupled with the eye-gouging price of the pro version lost it two stars. I paid, but I am NOT happy with the price.",neutral

6681,"Great format and tracking. £7 seems excessive for upgrade feature to use as a widget...

6719,"Overall I love this app and find it very useful. My main issue is sometimes my reminders don't pop up? Which is kind of irritating considering I use it to remember my birth control. When it doesn't remind me, I'll often completely forget to take it or remember a few hours after when I'm supposed to take it.

All you get is some minuscule, measly bar graphs which are tiny...and get this, they don't even label the metric you're tracking as they are displayed in the order in which your goal list is. So unless you memorize that goal #7 is say exercise daily, you won't even know what you're looking at. Additionally, the streaks are glitchy as hell, and often times do not calculate correctly. Really wish they also had aggregate goals, for example grouping similar goals together and then tracking the success percent for the aggregate. Like say if you have multiple diet goals for no dairy, no gluten, and no sugar, it would be great to group those in the diet category and then see your success there overall and trending graphs. And come on, add some pie charts and the ability to look at graphs in intervals aside from a single month.",neutral

6820,The tracker has a clean interface and it's simple to set up habits. I've only experienced one glitch: sometimes when you're looking at the calendar view of a habit the heading won't show up. If I could improve the app I would make the habit description show up in the habit calendar page. Right now you have to click on the habit name to view the description. I would also make an option to include skip days so if you need to skip a habit it doesn't count against your streak progress.,positive
6821,"It is such a great app to help you manage your time! I really like the fact that it can set the reminder time in a very specific way, it is perfect for people who have a different schedule everyday. One thing to point out will be the choice of the habit. Although you can type it yourself, wont really affect anything, I would like to have more type of habit to choose except for clicking ""other"". Also, it is sad that you need to pay for back up, but it is understandable.",positive
6822,"I love it, simple and effective! Is it right that the motivational pics don't switch anymore? Mine has been stuck on the very same for a year now :(",positive
6823,Great app for succeeding with your good habits. The widgets are especially useful since you are constantly reminded if you haven't completed one of your habits. I also like the discussion page but I miss some sort of timestamp to show when the post/comment was posted. Sometimes you reply on a post that has been dead for quite a while without knowing it.,positive

6826,"It's a good app. I like the encouraging reminders and memes each day. I wish there were just a couple more openings for tracking, but overall it's good. It doesn't eat my battery like the last one I tried. In fact. I'm readjusting to use in the coming year.",positive
6827,"Great app.. please add the ability to see when recurring habit is due.. or by automatically completing a habit which is not due, i.e. required once a week for example..",positive
6828,Extremely easy user interface. Helpsnin using the app more and note the goals.,positive
6829,"Simple, easy to use.... makes it very easy to keep track of habits...",positive
6830,"Good app, tracks nicely good widget. Sometimes notifications can be a bit flaky.",positive
6831,Its the best app when it comes to tracking your progress but one problem thats why i didnt give it a 5 star when you set reminders it doesn't work maybe on my phone but it doesn't send you reminders.. besides that its really a good app to kick start 2020,positive
6832,"I love how easy this app is to use, the only disadvantage is that you can track only 5 habits for free. If you want to use it for more you have to buy the pro. But what it does, it does well.",positive
6833,"Really good at what it does, but I've asked for support for what seem to be glitches transferring data between devices twice and gotten nothing back. That's frustrating.",positive
6834,"The simplicity is nice, but sometimes I want something with more detail. I use it in conjunction with another app. If I don't have a lot of time to enter info, it's great for that. I like that you can change the background to dark which isn't so jarring if you are using just before bed and are trying to avoid being stimulated by technology. I do wish, though, that you could change the setup of a Habit entered between a simple click or entering more detail. Right now you have to create a new Habit if you want to change, but then that changes your stats.",positive
6835,Very useful app for establishing good habits: I like the weekly view in particular. Also like being able to set the level of chatter and reminders done to the minimum in the free version.,positive
6836,"Using for a week now, i like seeing the statistics and that the free version will track 5 habits.",positive
6837,"Excellent app. Does everything you want a habit tracking app to do. Only complaint is the app counts the current day in your progress with no option to change that. So it looks like you are less successful than you really have been on a daily activity done near the end of each day. For example, if I am tracking going to the gym after work everyday and have been successful for 2 weeks, the app will show me as less than 100% successful until I indicate today is successful. Need to fix that.",positive
6838,"This is a super cool and helpful app. I love it. My only criticism is that it could be a bit more user friendly... it's easy to set up habits you want to DO (drink 8 glasses water per day) but harder to set up ""I only want this many ___ per week"". Additionally, the funny reminders are funny... because they're ridiculous. I don't think an English speaker wrote them, but I can't convince myself to disable them because they're so strange. 😂",positive
6839,It's pretty good. I wish you could change the type of selector though (yes/no vs x times a day) after habit creation. It seems there is no way to do this yet.,positive
6840,I like the app. It is very practical and quick to apply but you have to purchase more targets if you want and there is no inspiring pictures I think I should pay for it too.,positive
6841,"I like that the app in simple. I turned off the motivational quotes, so all I see is the calendar. And that's all I need to see! One thing I would add, though, is the ability to add exception so missed days don't count against my streak. One of my goals is a daily activity that I can only do at home. When I travel, I miss those days. But I did it every day I was able (i.e. every day I was home), so it's a bit of a downer to be penalized.",positive
6842,I just downloaded it to see the continuity of work I do. I found it personally useful. 1st : I am reminded by the large display of tracking down my habit. which I wanted to continue. 2nd : Now I can read the comments I entered after finishing the tasks. Now it is becoming habit for me to keep track on my habits that i see improvement in overall doing. i hope i still achieve lot more through this app. I heartly thank to the developers and creators of this app. signing off.,positive
6843,"So far, so good. I love the reminders because they check in you throughout the day, rather than just once a day. This has definitely helped me develop a routine. I may keep it on longer than the prescribed 66 days. The app claims it takes that long to develop a lasting habit but the daily reminders help me best. This app is good for that.",positive
6844,"Basic version works as described; just not what I need. The habits I want to improve require reminders at different times of day. And I'm personally not finding it an effective incentive, especially 'starting over' if missing one time. That's kind of a carrot AND stick approach. I'll stick to a simple checklist of what, & calendar/alarm clock to remind me when. Making this app's functions kind of ...basic and redundant? And since all apps use space... well, uninstalled. But the app works fine.",positive
6845,I really like this app. Some things could improve like the quote box fitting the whole quote in it. And the colors being more distinguishable. Thanks!,positive
6846,"Great app. My only problem is some of my habits I created doesn't work; I set a habit so I don't do something atleast 8 days of the month, but it links all the days inbetween successful days together. I only end up being successful for 6 days out of the month, but then it says 20+ days successful, because it link all the successful days together. Going to try other apps, unless I can resolve this issue.",positive
6847,"Habitbull is great. I love how customizable it is for making different types of habits. Tracking my current streak is great for motivating me to keep on going. And even if I break my streak, I love that it shows my ""best score"" so I have a new goal to reach. The only thing I would suggest is having a ""user suggestions"" button in the settings. I have emailed about a new type of habit a couple times and have never heard anything back. User feedback is always good for making a great app even better",positive
6848,"Great app, easy to use, nice design, motivating statistics and quotes. Thank you developers for this app :). Only one remark from me: if I change the number of repetitions per week of an activity, it changes the whole statistics (also for the previous period). Maybe there could be an option to apply this change only to further period (e.g. when I start an activity twice a week, it becomes a habit and I want to increase it to 3 times a week and I don't want to lose/worsen previous statistics).",positive
6849,Great app. Life changing if used properly. Easy to use. I have paid for premium but not getting my reminders popping up with notifications for app on. Can you help?,positive
6850,"Great app. Quite simple, it has a specific purpose, but does it well.",positive
6851,"this app has really helped me work on some habits! I appreciate that it reminded me if I didn't enter information for a day. I would have liked features like setting a time for those messages, or cool sounds when I click that I've done something, but for a free app, this was good enough as it was!",positive
6852,"I've just installed this app and so far, it seems like exactly what I had been looking for! Kudos. I just have one suggestion. The app exits on pressing the back button once. Most apps exit on pressing the back button twice, which works great for the user experience, in my opinion. So, it would be really great if you could incorporate that. Hoping to use this app every day!",positive
6853,I love the app. It has helped me a lot by helping me easily track my habits. I gave it a four because I sent them an email months ago they never answered.,positive
6854,Simple app that provides all I need to track habits. UI could use a refresher.,positive
6855,"The widgets look great, and i like the idea behind this app, but it feels like im fighting it to create goals where i would have to start over completely to make it a single task vs a quantity. also my biggest issue is that you cant set a quantity per week, only per day. i want to be able to set x number of hours per week doing a task without any daily requirements",positive
6856,Works well. The interface is a little odd. You have to scroll down to see all the graphs.,positive
6857,"This app is literally the only thing that reminds me to take my meds. I love getting the notifications and tracking my progress so easily. However I just upgraded to the pro version specifically for the sync capability and...it does not work. -1 star. For $10, I would hope that the one feature I wanted would function like it's supposed to. I'm not happy about that at all. The home screen widget comes in handy so it's not a total loss but that alone is not worth the price. Please fix syncing!",positive
6858,"It's the best habit tracker out there but it's not the best it can possibly be. After a substantial amount of thought, I succumbed and shelled out the 10 euros for the premium version to be able to use the widget, which is essential to keep me on track. However, the widget doesn't respond unless the application is opened beforehand, so minus one star for that. Also, a true black widget or user-interface would be very nice for AMOLED screens, so fingers crossed for that too.",positive
6859,"The one major short-coming of this app. (and most other ""habit trackers"") is that it does not have any option to calculate a total number (amount of hours, etc.) for a week or month--only a number of days or per day...That is a gaping deficit in these app's (with the exception of one or two with less desirable formats), as it is a far better way to track things like sleep which may fluctuate from.day to day. The other dismaying factor is that Habitbull doesn't seem to have any customer service, as I e-mailed numerous times about issues trying to upgrade (because it is a really helpful/useful application), and never got any response in about a year's time. :-\ Aside from the tabulation inadequacy discussed above--which I really hope they'll address/include that capability, it is a really helpful and useful app., and can be especially helpful for people with issues such as depression or ""OCD"" who may have difficulty keeping a handle on self-care and/or productivity (though, it could, also have the opposite effect, if people with ""OCD"" get too immersed in tracking things in their day-to-day :-S). In general, it is a good tool to have, though, and can help you make a lot of progress on things like household projects, etc., but I really do wish that they'd adjust it so that you can calculate a total for a duration of time longer than a day, and that they would also be conscientious about customer service/support and responding to/fielding correspondence and issues people encounter. ~*Kristin Star*",positive
6860,"Absolutely love this app. 4 out of 5 for two reasons. One, navigation, I think swiping between habits rather than scrolling would be a better interphase and also more intuitive. Scrolling habits only goes one direction, swiping could go both, as long as you're off the calendar. Two, the free version only can track five habits. I'll probably buy the app for full access, because this truly is a good app. However just a few more, say 10 instead of 5 in the free version would've been appreciated.",positive
6861,"This is a great app for me. The app is easy to navigate and the motivational quotes are a nice touch. I give this app 4 stars because I have an issue with the notifications. I want the app to remind me to do a certain task a certain amount of times throughout the day, but it only sends me the notification once I open the app which defeats the purpose of the notification. Not sure if I'm the only experiencing this problem? Other than that, I use this app on the daily.",positive
6862,"It's simple to use: you don't need to be a coder to figure it out. I like that there's a message board. I am considering using it to form a support group so I can stay on track with my workouts. Also, I didn't realize there are a lot of people who hate themselves for masturbating lol. But it's good they can find support in the message board. I read that you can only have 5 habits you can track. I'm being pragmatic and starting out with 4. But eventually I will need more than 5.",positive
6863,Nice configuration settings. Able to set most goals. One setting that I couldn't get to work for me was trying to get a goal for every other day. It seemed to that the goal needed to be completed every second day and comoleting it on off days didn't work. The UI is slightly un-intuitive as well. I don't think swiping up on a goal calendar should swap to another goal. It makes it hard to scroll down to the community form at the bottom if the app.,positive
6864,"I love this app and the widgets are awesome. 1 star lost because I am frequently getting pop ups (about 5 a day) stating it stopped and to restart app. And there is no update available. I might uninstall if this continues and it gets on my nerves. For now, works for what I need it for.",positive
6865,"App is nice! It works fine. I think it might just be better if it can give some rewards (maybe points or what) whenever you exceed your goals. I also do not understand some items in the app like the red translucent thing that goes on when you tap the dates the 2nd time and why it decreases % when red. Maybe you can make the app more user friendly. I also sometimes feel offended by being catcalled by the app notifications. I don't think it's appropriate. Still, it's a great app.",positive
6866,The percentage calculation and the number of days successful in a week/ month seems confusing. Otherwise it's a really good app.,positive
6867,"this app works for me this app is able to be customize. I don't ""fit the box"" for most general apps. I do wish that social piece wasnt there, where you have the ability to what other are people have listed as their habit to break. I think there may be trolls getting kicks to see their obsurd habits stay at the top of this list. On a positive note you can hide this.",positive
6868,i suggest a positive running tab amd also a negative running tab! i love the app and it really makes a difference in tracking my daily habits. the only thing i have found that would make it better is if i could track relapses. this would require it to allow something that i do NOT want to mark for a day amd when it is marked then it would be a negative. this would help responsibility to be accounted for the relapse. i would like these negstives to be separateky counted from the positive marks.,positive
6869,"Newly installed re: resolutions. Seems to be a bug on Android when I set a target date it sets it to the day after. If I go back in and change it back one day, it keeps it. Please fix. Seems like a great app. Purchased to export data because data is beautiful lol. Thank you.",positive
6870,"This tool really helps me see my progress so that I can feel motivated to change. When I see that I have been on a successful streak, it helps me believe that I can make positive changes for real and forever. I only did four stars because if you want to track more than 5 things you have to pay. Also, their forums seem to only feature drug and sex addicts. It's kind of creepy really...but you aren't required to participate...so I ignore it.",positive
6871,"A great app overall. Complete and specific in terms of types of goals. User interface aspects like fonts and some screens like the first ""create habit"" screen seem a little heterogeneous when compared to the rest of the app; in other words, they seem displaced, out of vibe. I suggest a review of the UI; maybe making it a little less cluttery and cleaner. For example, the google fit prompts and font correlation. It is a great work nevertheless, congratulations!",positive
6872,"I've had this for about 6 months now and tbh its helped me out. you're allowed 5 free habits. any more than that you have to pay but i think 5 is a great start because you dont want to bombard yourself with too many changes. its simple, easy to use...it takes awhile to form habits so be patient and honest with your entries. it'll help you see where you're failing and succeeding by %. i noticed i did habits because i didnt want to fail. now i notice i perform habits because i want to excel.",positive
6873,"Great app. Just bought Platinum. My only issue is when setting my goal for a habit. Let's say I have a habit named '1 hour of study'. And I set my goal to doing this 5 times a day. Even if I would only do it twice (meaning 2 hours) each day the app would show it as a streak, even though I haven't reached my actual goal during any of the days. So it does see it as a success even though it wasn't for me. Could you maybe implement an option to make it possible to show those as unsuccessful?",positive
6874,"I enjoyed using Habitbull in the past and decided to give it another go. Not a lot has changed. I do like the app, very simple to use and gives great reminders.",positive
6875,"really effective app. best widget of all the habit tracking apps I've tried. But the widget can be a little glitchy and I wish there were a compact version. some of the UX leaves a little to be desired. I'd love to see some small improvements espec to widgets, but still definitely worth using. premium paid user.",positive
6876,"I like this app as it helps to track things that are important for me. I'm still exploring how effective the method is but I like what I found so far! It'd be nice to have a way to see the correlations or tendencies among habits if any. Good job, nice idea!",positive
6877,"overall it gets the job done, but the notifications are confusing to set and are inconsistent when reminding you about your about. Some days I'm reminded and some I'm not, so it's kinda been up to me to remind myself. but the app itself is easy to use and effective at tracking.",positive
6878,"its a good app, the cool thing for me is that you can comment per day, so if you fail with your habits you can find out what things stand in your way, i withdraw one star because i want to make a feature request: when you select ""all habits "" i also want to see all comments (mixed) this way the app would also be a holistic diary , thx :-)",positive
6879,"Great motivator to keep a habit going. Also good for keeping track of habits you already have. They have great, insightful options that help you set your goal. Tried a similar highly rated app (forgot its name) and this one destroys it. Immediately uninstalled the other one. There are a few quarks here and there they can improve, but overall I really like this app and have recommended kt to friends and family.",positive
6880,It's very simple to use. I like that you can set as either a yes/no habit or a rep like two times a day. My only hangup would be that the free version only allows tracking for five habits but that can be a bonus if your just getting started. You don't want to overwhelm yourself.,positive
6881,"It helped me alot. And there is a bug. If app is opened via notification message, password will not be required no matter. Hope you fix this bug soon",positive
6882,Simple and helpful once I figured out how it works. I wish it didn't cost money to work on more than 5 habits..,positive
6883,It's a great app for tracking habits. So far I find that purchasing the premium app has been worth every penny.,positive
6884,"Regardless of my free version this app's intention is to help it's users increase positive habits and reduce negative habits. For someone like me who needs feedback, the percentage of success gives me an incentive and motivates me to keep the chain going. After using this app for almost two months I have been able to analyze and critique a few of the apps features. It would be interesting to know scientific statistics of the success of the app and if it is successful in what it is set out to do. In regards to the level of engagement I would say that the percentage strategy keeps me coming back to this app. For functionality, the free version runs smoothly, is clear, and easy to use. For aesthetics, it is simple and convenient however I do think that for some users it might be difficult to see due to size of buttons and font size. The information is a bit outdated and needs to be cited and should come from more credible sources. I do enjoy seeing that there is a discussion board for communication between users. From my subjective analysis this app's rating is a 4.1.",positive
6885,Works pretty good to help you remember to do certain things and make them a habit. Encouraging to see the streak when you accomplish what you set out to do. Would have been a 5* but sometimes it attaches circles when a day didn't get done.,positive
6886,I very much enjoy this app. it has helped me greatly and its easy and fun to use. There is one issue though. I do not enjoy having an app call me affectionate names such as darling and sunshine. Quite frankly it makes my stomach turn everytime this happens. I like this app so much I bought the premium version but the fact that the app was calling me pet names made me almost delete it. I plan on continuing to use habitbull but I sincerely hope this weird occurrence is changed.,positive
6887,Great but can be annoying with notifications and also is not quite as customizable as I'd like. Definitely helps to track your habbita though!,positive
6888,"I would like to set the begin date in the past, then indicate the total number of days and have app calculate end date. i would like to see the end date on calendar, number of days remaining, and an option to have days marked complete as the default. also, stop asking me to rate when i already have please.",positive
6889,"the app has helped me track my habits and create new better habbits. i have been 7 weeks drinking nothing but water and have been on and off with candy and snacks. just like any other habit tracking app, this will not do the work for you. it is here to hell you keep track of the work you are putting forth, and it does a good job at that.",positive
6890,great habit tracking app and you get plenty without premium. I like the premium widgets quite a bit and the extra habits. Would be better if it had the option to flag a habit as skipped rather than fail without breaking the chain for when you can't do it. E.g. In bed early when you have to stay back late at work.,positive
6891,"Very effective for every day tasks, but once a week or once every x number of days is a bit confusing to set up.",positive
6892,"Pretty good at what it does, exactly what I needed. However, there is a small bug - weekly review widget does not show all my habits. Moreover, I miss a feature to periodically share my weekly/monthly reviews on social media, or with at least with someone. Accountability helps.",positive
6893,"great app, I just wish one thing could change. some of my habits need a long title, and it doesnt show the full title if I click 'all habits' or even on each single habit. if the title could allow more characters, or another line, I'll add the last star! lol (please)",positive
6894,"So far, the best habit tracking app I've tried, the only one I was able to actually stick to using. If only full version would be more avaliable..",positive
6895,Awesome App that has really kept me on track. I just wish there was some type of reward system once you've reached your goal. I think regular reminders (perhaps with some form of motivation attached to it) would also encourage discipline and drive.,positive
6896,I bought the premium version of this app. It is easy to use and I love the reminders sent to my Galaxy watch to keep me on track. I would like bolder colour coding to differentiate the goals being tracked and success/failure indicators. Overall a great purchase.,positive
6897,"It's a great tool to start, track and keep habits. Since I started using it I've been adding more habits I want to build and this app keeps me organized and reminds me of my habit goals. I get to compete wirh myself and see where I have room for improvement.",positive
6898,"I really love this app, it helped me quit smoking but I have a few comments I would like to make 1. the badges you receive on certain days are not saved, I think it will be more motivating when you know that you are reaching milestones 2. the discussions I posted are also not saved, I would like to see my journey posts to keep me motivated as well and to also see how other people interact with them. I still love this app a lot and really recommend it",positive
6899,"3rd week. great for monitoring things you want to become habits. the humor in the notifications is lost on me. i wish for non monitoring days there would be a third color option with a continuance of the chain. other than that, its simole to setup and simple to use.",positive
6900,"this is the best app I have ever used to keep track of my activities.The greatest part is that each time you feel like giving up to achieving your objectives, it will always remind you, which is very motivating. I only have one problem though,having trouble with syncronising my progress, which means if the app was to be accidentally uninstalled and then reinstalled again, then all the progress I had saved would be lost, so this one reason I give you a 4 star rating instead of a 5.Good app though",positive
6901,Easy to use but it seems really basic,positive
6902,Love it except I can't change the positive memes at the bottom anymore.,positive
6903,Great app... I am using it for a while... Functionality wise it the best in the market... It can get updated in terms of visuals and performance,positive
6904,UI/UX can be improved a bit more,positive
6905,"I love it, simple and effective! Is it right that the motivational pics don't switch anymore? Mine has been stuck on the very same for a year now :(",positive
6906,i like the design,positive
6907,Heyyy dear Developers..!! Love the app.. but have a issue in it.. IDK if it is only with me.. the App doesn't show any reminder after 1 day of setting a habit goal.. only 1st day it does..,positive
6908,"In general, this app helps me keep track of my habits, which is great; however, the app has quite a few bugs, even after buying the premium version, which is disappointing. The sync function doesn't work at all and I don't see any effort to fix these issues. This is one of the rare apps where I won't be giving a 5 star review.",positive
6909,"Very good and gets the job done, not the prettiest or well designed but certainly not the worst! It's exactly how it's pictured and works fabulously too. No crashing or issues here.",positive
6910,"Good app, tracks nicely good widget. Sometimes notifications can be a bit flaky.",positive
6911,Extremely easy user interface. Helpsnin using the app more and note the goals.,positive
6912,"Simple, easy to use.... makes it very easy to keep track of habits...",positive
6913,"I like the app. Have been using it for a few months now, and the widgets plus reminders definitely keep me on track. Only drawback I've found is the inability to sync my profile - always fails with 'sync failed, make sure you have a working internet connection'. Have sent in support request, but so far no response. That aside, the app works well, and I can still use it in 'standalone' mode on my primary Android phone.",positive
6914,It is all for me about habits i wasn't able to work on it but in this one it is so helpful just i have one issue i don't know if didn't find it or it is not at the program that if u need to remind your self more than one time in the day i just remind my self once a day i don't know if it in the app or not,positive
6915,Amazing experience,positive
6916,"App is great. Helps me keep track of my daily habits. I like how the interface is simple and easy to use. However, I've been experiencing issues tracking my habits using the widget.",positive

6918,Best habit tracker app i have used,positive
6919,"Fun and engaging way to track your goals and form better habits. I'm still not great at keeping up with it, but the app works well when I spend the time to pay attention to it.",positive
6920,Easy to use and very flexible.,positive
6921,Great way to hold yourself accountable for setting goals,positive
6922,It's cool because it's gives me motivation to push myself and allow me to see my struggle in addiction for every day I fail.,positive
6923,Worked well for my purposes,positive
6924,"Nice app, would like further customization for habits, such as perhaps scores, the better you tackle a habit (healthier eating today than yesterday resulting in a higher score) this would make the app much more useful for me, otherwise great app",positive
6925,Love the reminder to log your habits,positive
6926,"Great app. Quite simple, it has a specific purpose, but does it well.",positive
6927,"Liked the setup so much that I quickly became a premium user. The widget alone is worth it. I love the flexibility the app allows in specifying when I can work on developing a habit. As I am frequently adding habits, I would like to rearrange habits in the list to make it easier to find them. Hopefully, this is an easy fix. Then this will be a 5-star app.",positive
6928,"A good starter app 4 collecting the data you need to better your daily life. Limited flexibility, in the free version, but sufficient four basic tracking of self-improvement efforts. Easy to get started. And so I can do without cute reminder and encouragement features, they are easy enough to toggle off.",positive
6929,Works well. The interface is a little odd. You have to scroll down to see all the graphs.,positive
6930,"Удобный, наглядный трекер привычек с подробной кастомизацией. К сожалению, не всегда корректно срабатывают напоминания - во всплывающем окне не нажимаются кнопки, приходится переходить в приложение, чтобы отметить выполненное действие.",positive
6931,"Havent been using it for a long time but so far so good. However, the paid version should have more features, such a costomizing your own categories. Also, the widget should be more customizable, such as font size.",positive
6932,"This app seems to work pretty well. The user forums aren't well managed, but remain useful. Habit Tracker has never crashed on me, but it does have the annoying habit of changing where in the UI has focus at the time you launch the app. Fortunately its easy to navigate.",positive
6933,Simple app that provides all I need to track habits. UI could use a refresher.,positive
6934,This is closest to my expectations,positive
6935,"I like this app, I have used it for a while now and it helps. Only reason for 4 stars is that the percentages are frustrating. I managed 122 days straight but it won't change from 98%. I think once you do the full 66 days you should get 100%. Also, would love to be able to highlight a day in the future as a milestone, just different colour so I can say 50, 100 days etc, as a motivator. It's great for a free app. We'll done to the devs on this.",positive
6936,"Love this app, but it only lets you keep track of only 5 habits at once, for more you have to buy premium, but other than that, its great!",positive
6937,it works well for me,positive
6938,"Great app.. please add the ability to see when recurring habit is due.. or by automatically completing a habit which is not due, i.e. required once a week for example..",positive
6939,It would be a very good choice for those who want a daily base motivation to make your way to build on the habbit..try not to break the streak of your habbit goals at any cost from which you can gain the max from this app . Well built interface with motivational images loved it❤,positive
6940,"Using for a week now, i like seeing the statistics and that the free version will track 5 habits.",positive
6941,Its useful,positive
6942,Very helpful,positive
6943,Would be perfect if you also have pomodoro/timer to do each task,positive
6944,Good visual reminder and nice to see patterns of habit breaking,positive
6945,Just the best. This app has helped me improve at a time I was feeling very down and unable to do anything.. I only wish the notifications worked better.,positive
6946,Great app.,positive
6947,Easy to use.,positive
6948,Does what it promises.. tracks habits 👍,positive
6949,"This has been very helpful with tracking my habits for hopefully having remission with my fibromyalgia . It sucks that there is only 5 habits you can put in, but if you think about it.. 5 habits is more then enough to start trying to break. Go any more and you overwhelm yourself",positive
6950,"Good tracker, but with subscription based model",positive
6951,Great app but I would prefer some changes in its interface.,positive
6952,Why I unable to sync the apps in my phone?,positive
6953,Its the best app when it comes to tracking your progress but one problem thats why i didnt give it a 5 star when you set reminders it doesn't work maybe on my phone but it doesn't send you reminders.. besides that its really a good app to kick start 2020,positive
6954,nice app,positive
6955,"I'd give it 5, but drropping a star because it shows useless notifications every time I open it",positive
6956,I have to uninstall it because i need more habits to track but the free version cant provide more than 5 habits.,positive
6957,The percentage calculation and the number of days successful in a week/ month seems confusing. Otherwise it's a really good app.,positive
6958,"It's a good app. I like the encouraging reminders and memes each day. I wish there were just a couple more openings for tracking, but overall it's good. It doesn't eat my battery like the last one I tried. In fact. I'm readjusting to use in the coming year.",positive
6959,"Great habit tracking tool. The widget on the home screen is a great size so I can see quickly how well I'm doing, and the options at set up are thorough. I'm tracking all sorts of things and it's easy to see how I'm doing. Highly recommended. Only concern is I'm having trouble getting a response on a _potential_ issue I have (not sure it's real yet, but if it is I'm concerned). Otherwise five stars.",positive
6960,"Recording the amount of when the day is successful, need to be easier",positive
6961,I think it's really helpful but I want some more functions. However I still dont know what exactly they will be. Make me surprised :))),positive
6962,👍👍😎😎😎,positive
6963,I like the app!! I even paid premium for it But can you please make it connect in to the app when I press the widget?,positive
6964,"Really good at what it does, but I've asked for support for what seem to be glitches transferring data between devices twice and gotten nothing back. That's frustrating.",positive
6965,Great app verry helpfull and can be improved more.,positive
6966,I dont get notifications regarding my daily goals.,positive
6967,Very helpful,positive
6968,Great but can be annoying with notifications and also is not quite as customizable as I'd like. Definitely helps to track your habbita though!,positive
6969,Goooood app.Helps to get in track.,positive
6970,Overall great app. Love it!,positive
6971,Pretty good app to keep track of your bad habits you want to quit,positive
6972,Good Experience,positive
6973,It's a great app for tracking habits. So far I find that purchasing the premium app has been worth every penny.,positive
6974,Very useful app for establishing good habits: I like the weekly view in particular. Also like being able to set the level of chatter and reminders done to the minimum in the free version.,positive
6975,"I enjoyed using Habitbull in the past and decided to give it another go. Not a lot has changed. I do like the app, very simple to use and gives great reminders.",positive
6976,"I've only been using this app for a week or so but I love it. It's easy to set up and use, and I appreciate that it gives me a percentage of my successful days.",positive
6977,I like the app. It is very practical and quick to apply but you have to purchase more targets if you want and there is no inspiring pictures I think I should pay for it too.,positive
6978,Better than most. User friendly.,positive
6979,good,positive
6980,I love the app. It has helped me a lot by helping me easily track my habits. I gave it a four because I sent them an email months ago they never answered.,positive
6981,It's pretty good. I wish you could change the type of selector though (yes/no vs x times a day) after habit creation. It seems there is no way to do this yet.,positive
6982,"Best habit tracker I've used. Notifications aren't consistent, though.",positive
6983,Really helped me up my discipline,positive
6984,It's a good way to keep track of your habits. Habits are easy to change if you decide to track something different.,positive
6985,Goood,positive
6986,Very helpful.. Please add more habits for the free version,positive
6987,"Great app, but only 5 habit is free 😏",positive
6988,"The only suggestion I have is to make it so if you deactivate then reactivate a habit, it doesn't take your percentage down as if it was active the while time.",positive
6989,Love the flexibility and options to track habits,positive
6990,So far so good 👍,positive
6991,It's been good using this app to track habit formation,positive
6992,Great app. Life changing if used properly. Easy to use. I have paid for premium but not getting my reminders popping up with notifications for app on. Can you help?,positive
6993,"I love how easy this app is to use, the only disadvantage is that you can track only 5 habits for free. If you want to use it for more you have to buy the pro. But what it does, it does well.",positive
6994,I been looking for such an app and finally found it. It's really nice and I can keep a record of my activities on daily basis.,positive
6995,Just what I was looking for. It's simple which is all it needs to be.,positive
6996,"This is by far my favorite habit tracking app (and I've tried many). I like the weekly view. (I have an unusual use for this app.....I use it to track my kids' school work and I like the weekly view so I can see what they have completed during the week). However, I'm not sure if this app is still being supported? The last update was over a year ago and they do not respond to inquiries. But the app does still work well.",positive
6997,I really like this app. Some things could improve like the quote box fitting the whole quote in it. And the colors being more distinguishable. Thanks!,positive
6998,this is helpful for accountability,positive
6999,Great app for succeeding with your good habits. The widgets are especially useful since you are constantly reminded if you haven't completed one of your habits. I also like the discussion page but I miss some sort of timestamp to show when the post/comment was posted. Sometimes you reply on a post that has been dead for quite a while without knowing it.,positive
7000,I have used several habit tracking apps and this one is the best. It is easy to use and I like the way it gives my percentage success rate and my streaks. A lot of the other apps wanted a monthly subscription fee. I paid for the pro version after using the free version since it was a one time payment.,positive
7001,"Great habit tracking app. The only things I think could be improved are: goal dates not automatically pushing back to match the day you edited a habit. And being able to edit how you want to track a habit if you change your mind. Maybe I missed something, but it seems like you have to recreate a habit in order to change how to keep track of it (ex. Yes/No or by keeping count with numbers). I highly recommend this tool though, it's a great place to start keeping track of habits!",positive
7002,"Easy to set up and daily tracking is very simple. Visual display is great. If a habit is set for every other day, or with some other gap in between, the app shows a chain with open circles rather than solidly-colored circles. Likewise, if the goal is a specific number of minutes or repetitions, it color-codes the entry differently depending on whether you met or did fewer reps than the goal. Only using the free app for now but plan to upgrade.",positive
7003,"Superb app. My one piece of advice for others would be to set low, reasonable targets for yourself and slowly increase them over time. Much better to start going to the gym twice a week, succeed and increase from there than to set the goal of 7 days a week and fail and become disheartened when you dont hit it. App is superb though.",positive
7004,"Excellent app, excellent widgets. I use this with widget as my daily habit manager. Could do with an update and could have other features but what it does (help maintain habit streaks) it does better than any other app I've found. I bought premium one off to use the apps.its worth it for me. Don't usually buy subscriptions but a couple dollars once off worth it. Free to use though, only widgets are premium",positive
7005,"Tracking my progression on goals has never been easier! This app is so simple, yet it's amazing and I love that you can share your progression with friends for accountability. The only thing I don't understand is the various greetings/notifications they send you in different languages.",positive
7006,This is a very easy to use app which allows you to customize the habits you're trying to change or add. It allows you to set floor and ceiling goals within each habit and identifies your streaks. It's fantastic!,positive
7007,Great tool for tracking habits. Simple to use and it does as advertised. I like the daily reminders to update the calendar. It helped with my motivation to keep up the efforts!,positive
7008,"So far, so good. I've been using it for about a week. It's easy to set up habits, a schedule, and reminders. Checking things off and seeing my success rate is very motivating to me. I upgraded. It's a one-time fee of only $7.99.",positive
7009,"This app has been great for keeping my goals on track! I have the free version only. Supposedly, the paid version does not sync as it's supposed to so I would be wary of that if you were considering going premium.",positive
7010,I downloaded a bunch of habit-tracking apps to test them out before New Year's. Habitbull seemed the most intuitive and straightforward. I really like the design (shows the streak on the calendar) and the fact that it nudges you if you don't check in during the day. There's even a community function where you can share the struggle with others doing the same thing. Great app.,positive
7011,"My favorite habit tracking app! I am the author of multiple books on how to build better habits, and regularly speak at conferences on how to create behavioral change. This app is my secret tool for keeping myself accountable - and I recommend it to all my clients. Simple and easy to use. The one thing that would make it better would be if it had some ""reminders"" / notifications. Otherwise, it's close to perfect",positive
7012,"Super easy, and has changed my life in a number of very positive ways. Excellent tool. Buy the full version if you are able. Certainly worth it.",positive
7013,"Super useful app! Really nice visual way to keep track of what you're doing that you shouldn't be doing, and what you're avoiding that you know you should be doing! I'm using it to stop biting my nails, which I've tried to stop doing for probably 15 years! Also keeping track of when in sticking to my sleep and diet schedule, and a bunch of other habits I'm trying to establish. It's important to have a way to hold yourself accountable! And remember to be honest with yourself!",positive
7014,Nice application you can update everyday... The progress report gives extra motivation which we can see everyday... We can set the goal/target what we want to achieve. There is forum too where people will help you... If you have any doubt.,positive
7015,"Easy to use. Love that the % automatically updates. Free version only has 5 trackers, but honestly it's hard to focus on more than that.",positive
7016,"KISS! Easiest way to keep on track is to make tracking simple and encouraging. It's easy to set up. Features allow for various forms of success - yes/no, 5x/week (any days), number per day - and you get to decide. Worth a shot. You might even adopt that new habit!",positive
7017,Best app for tracking habits...could be better if it could be connected to the alarm and a better reminder system would have helped...otherwise this app is really helpful tajnk you sooo much guys!!!,positive
7018,"Best app ever! It keeps track of your habits and, if you turn on reminders, it also keeps you accountable of the goals you set. Simply genius!",positive
7019,"The best habit tracking app I've ever used. Set your own goals, no comments that make you feel guilty, and minimal annoying reminders.",positive
7020,It's a great little app. The free version allows you to put in up to 5 habits. You can customize the colors and order and you can see your progress. I like it!,positive
7021,I've always had issues with consistency and will power. It's very helpful when can see my progress. It even tracks the percentage of your success.,positive
7022,This app has helped me develop and stick to many useful habits. Highly recommend it to anyone who wants to develop a new habit but is finding it difficult.,positive
7023,"I like being able to look at my goals each day, review how I am doing, focus in the most important one for this month. I'm seeing improvement!",positive
7024,"it's a great up, easy to use and very helpful if you want to create new habits and track your progress!",positive
7025,This app is incredibly helpful. I need to take medication every morning and this app helps me make sure I take the tablet. It helps me build the habit of taking it.,positive
7026,"I've been looking for an app that can do what HabitBull does and I'm so glad I finally found it. It's a great, easy to use app and the messages you get are so cute.",positive
7027,"I've never been so pleased with an app like this. It designed well, easy to navigate, and keeps me motivated to improve my life!",positive
7028,Great to track simple stuff. I track exercise and days I stick to my diet. It is helping to keep me honest without much effort.,positive
7029,I love this habit app and the customization ootions. I use it to track exercise and also build up/break habits im trying to start/stop.,positive
7030,Great app. Good reports and tracking. UI is simple and does what it needs to do. Keeps it productive,positive
7031,Wonderful app that simply shows your progress of creating habits. Love the visual layout that helps he stay on track...,positive
7032,Really user friendly - effective in keeping track of your habits and achieving your goals. 100% recommend,positive
7033,Great app for tracking habits with tons of options! Only thing I can't seem to do is set a habit with a start date in the future. Is there a way to do this that I am missing? I'm a planner and like to set things up ahead of time. Otherwise it's fabulous!,positive
7034,It does exactly what it should do in a very clean yet detailed way. Excellent app that has helped me conquer addiction. I love it,positive
7035,I love it so far. Bummer to have to pay for premium but it's not a bad price. I am only doing the minimum 5 habits because I don't need that many. :) it could use a reminder notification 🔔 Update: still love this app. It's helped me keep track daily.,positive
7036,This has been really helpful keeping me on track. Having to mark your goals off each day has kept me more motivated than usual.,positive
7037,Does exactly what it should. Tips: don't overuse it if you're new to this. Put in one or two habits worth tracking and make them count. Make sure they're connected to your bigger goal or purpose and aim big. You're here to great work. Go for it!,positive
7038,"Works nice. Good to get visuals and numbers on your habits. One of my habits I've only been doing 50% of the time according to the app, although I thought I had been doing it a lot more. Solid app.",positive
7039,Very nice app I like the fact I am able to log in any type of event in the calender and track your progress.,positive
7040,"The app is excellent!! However, if you have not defined your specific goal (e.g.: I will read 5 pages of a book every night before I fall asleep) you will stop using it, so keep that in mind.",positive
7041,It is very useful when you want to track your daily habits. I have just started using it. It is like a one page map to all the habits that you want to follow. Use it if you are a person who wants to develop and keep track of habits.,positive
7042,Highly recommended. Super easy way to live an organised and healthy life; and to be the person you want to be.,positive
7043,Best daily tracker out there. Very easy to use and good UI. Lots of customization options. Download this if you are trying to build up a habit just simply tap on the circle daily to mark it. Would recommend,positive
7044,I love this app! It does not only track your habits but it also gives statics (%) about how well you are progressing to make it a sustainable habit. You can decide how long it takes you to make a habit sustainable.,positive
7045,"Really awesome app!!! Its definitely easier than other habit tracking apps I've tried, and better designed too. I get a lot of use out of it, so I purchased the full version. If you're trying to keep track of multiple things at once, especially with the goal of remembering to do things, this will help. I have horrible memory due to health issues so I sometimes forget to do basic things, and this keeps me on track.",positive
7046,"Absolutely fantastic! Clean, fast, non intrusive.",positive
7047,"I use this app to track various symptoms of my IBS. I also tried HabitHub and Loop, but only this app allowed me to track on a daily basis how many times a certain symptom occurred, and also set ""goals"" based on either ""no more than"" and ""no fewer than"" a given number of occurrences. I preferred the interface and graphs (I'd like to see a chart of raw numbers instead of just pass/fail) in some of the other apps, but from a purely functional standpoint this is the one to beat.",positive
7048,Habit Trackers makes it easy to keep track of your goals!! Love it!!!,positive
7049,"It's helped me stay on track with habits I want to cultivate. I'm really data driven and thrive on external validation, so I like seeing graphs and the calendar fill up with my successful days. It works well for me. The app itself is good too. It hasn't crashed or done anything unexpected in the week I've used ii find logging mt. The only thing I wish I could do is go back and change what makes a day successful.",positive
7050,"Simple and useful, and so far, bug free! Just what i wanted.",positive
7051,"I have always had problems when it comes to structure in my life. This app was a beautiful addition to my transformation in life, if i ever got slack or forgot to do something, I will make up for it the next day or even do it on the same day. Seeing consistency visually has definitely helped me to maintain structure and positive repetition. Thank you to the creators of this amazing app 😊 Goodluck to anyone who has attracted this app ✌",positive
7052,"I use it for keeping track of tasks after I complete them. I don't want a reminder of a task,I just need to keep track of it. This app allows me to disable reminders. Keeping track of them is as easy as checking off the day. It has the days circled based on how you schedule your tasks. The user experience is really easy. You can create multiple tasks (or habits to be), schedule them separately and keep track of them on one home page. It shows you stats etc to see your progress. Those for whom the reminders cause unnecessary stress (i.e. workout reminders), this app is better than calendar scheduling.",positive
7053,"My experience so far with this App has been great, so far I have been able to track my top 5 habits that I want to implement and maintain. The app has done a great job at making me enjoy meeting my goals. I recommend this App. I have not tried premium yet however will do so once I have more concrete research and evidence that it's works well too.",positive
7054,"well, thanks for the app and the nice touches and effort that've been put in it. However, there are other simple things you can adjust: - adding colors options for every habit - making marking with color scheme and check marks at the same time - making an access on laptop - when I put measurable habit he ask me about the account twice!! Idw what is for? I know you want to keep the app with beautiful simplicity, which is great, but you should offer more options for those who wants more",positive
7055,"This app is perfect for tracking my habits. It allows an effective level of depth without being overwhelming. I have been using this for several months and I love it. The only thing I would like to see would be ""Milestones"" to increase/decrease a habit without retroactively turning past week successes into failures. For example, increasing a workout habit from 2x/wk to 3x/wk.",positive
7056,"Great app if you want to get rid of bad habits, or reinforce good ones. The free version of it is not as restrictive as most free versions of apps, so that is a big plus . I honestly never really wrote a review on playstore before, but this app legitimately helped me overcome a few of my most detrimental bad habits. To the people that made the app, thank you for taking the time to make an amazing app! I hope that everyone has a wonderful day!",positive
7057,"I've tested dozens of habit and routine tracking apps. The clean layout, useful widgets, and versatility of this one puts it above the rest. Even without premium, it is highly functional. Furthermore, premium is a one-time purchase rather then a monthly/annual fee, which was a deciding factor for me.",positive
7058,"I have used many habit trackers over the years, but this was the one that most suited me. It's simple and effective, and even the free version is really useful, the only drawback (for the free version) would be that you cannot track more than 5 habits, but I don't want to follow that many habits either way so it was a perfect match for me!",positive
7059,"Helps keep my habits in check. It's nice to go back and see how I performed in months past. It's kind of confusing how they display the stats, but just now after a few months of use it's starting to make more sense.",positive
7060,I love this app! Very easy to use and it phelps me to keep track of my progress. A+,positive
7061,"To begin with I already loved this app because it's aesthetically pleasing very easy to use and all in all just keeps me in check with the things I want to keep up with in my life, I was having issues with my phone so I had to reset and when I try to log back in I didn't have any of the data and I had purchased premium and I didn't have that anymore and I reached out to the support team and they were able to completely help me and merge my account so that I had all my data again and my premium again with no issue within just a few hours they are amazing and I highly recommend this app!!!",positive
7062,"This app really helps me stay mindful of my daily goals. Being able to visualize my progress helps me to decide where to put more focus and what to prioritize each day. It's highly motivating for me personally to be able to tick off the goals I've met, and creates a great sense of satisfaction when I've achieved them. I highly recommend this app to anyone who could use a little help staying on top of daily tasks and accomplishing daily or weekly goals.",positive
7063,"I purchased the premium version so I can use the home screen widgets. It motivates me to stick to my habbits once I see them all the time when I use my phone. I've been using it for 2-3 weeks now and I woke up early, went to the gym, read at least 20 pages and flossed in the evening EVERYDAY. Obviously, is not all thanks to the app, but it does help to track my progress and keep me accountable if I miss anything. Just start with easy to achieve habbits to make it work long term and build on that.",positive
7064,"Love this app, the basic version is fine, but I love being able to add even more items in the paid-version! Keeps me on track all day.",positive
7065,"Still the best habit tracker I've ever used. Unfortunately, the widgets only respond directly after I've removed and replaced them again. I'm really hoping they work some day.",positive
7066,"I've been using this app for about 3 years now, it is by far the most user friendly habit tracking app I've tried.",positive
7067,"This app is a simple an elegant solution for tracking habits, it offers widgets as well as a nice simple interface for getting habits done. I guess if i had to complain I think i had an issue where if there was a task set to be complete x days a week it would not go away on the widget ever even if you had done the task the required amount of times a week, could have been my mistake however, otherwise great!",positive
7068,"I totally recommend this app. It had help me on every possible way. It's really helpful if you really want to develop a new habit. I specialy like the easyness to configure the habits and the reminders; the motivational notes that you can find around are just right. But its true that is not a magic app, PLEASE if you want to create a new habit, you have to work for it, you have to work to create something. If you do that, you'll see the true colors of this magnificent app. Be true to yourself.",positive
7069,"The #1 Best Habit Tracking app in my opinion. You can record the amount of activities you do and see the final result at the end of week. When recording your activities, It shows your average amount of the activities done during the week . This app also keeps my life back on track and reminds me what i need to do throughout the day and its very convenient. This app is extremely easy to use and it is free! I honestly wouldnt be able to live without it. Thank you. ❤️",positive
7070,Very helpful to be mindful of areas you want to change and feels rewarding as you see streaks of success. It is easy to use. It's design allows you to take baby steps towards more ambitious goals. Also setup manages your goals so they are realistically obtainable. Reminders setup is very flexible so notifications are useful and welcome. Great user friendly design which is highly customizable,positive
7071,It has been really easy to use and effortlessly works. Gives me the % of all the habits I am doing together and individually!! Great so far!!,positive
7072,Very helpful. Simple and effective app design. Support from others and discussion helps a lot to form a habit as well as get rid of bad ones. Password lock ensures safety. the developers have definitely put lots of work into this app. Free version and premium works great. I ordered premium and it's worth the money.,positive
7073,"This app has been great for me, especially to track daily goals I set for myself. it shows me the days I have succeeded, and the days Ive fallen short. I can see a history of my success and setup reminders to make sure I don't miss a daily goal. I've been using the app for a little over a month now and highly recommend it to anyone who has daily goals they want to rack and be successful with!",positive
7074,"Fits my needs. The free version is limited to five items being tracked, but it would be counterproductive to try and develop more than two habits at a time.",positive
7075,"This app makes me want to accomplish my goals. It's so useful and helpful. Because I don't want to break my streaks, I find that I push my self to accomplish the daily habits I created in the app. Thank you dev!",positive
7076,I've found this app really useful for assisting my success in various areas . Sometimes stopping certain poor habits and sometimes starting positive new ones.,positive
7077,"10/10 Great app! Let's you keep track of goals and habits daily. It's highly customizable and will send you notifications to remind you of stuff, if you want. Also I really like the message boards, I find them really inspirational. Also, I've been using this app for several months, and it's never asked me to pay anything. And there aren't any ads either. I know that there's a premium version in one of the side menus, but I'm not sure what it does because it already gives you everything you want.",positive
7078,"Elegant design. This app is easy to use and only takes seconds. Unlike other apps that distract you with details, blog posts, etc (I'm looking at you, myfitnesspal), I can easily track my habits in seconds without going down the internet rabbit hole **edited to add that I'm still using it weeks later. Very simple. Although I started off ambitious and added many habits, I ended up following the developers suggestion and paring back to two key habits. I'll add more after these stick",positive
7079,"Well, like anything this app is only as useful as you're willing to let it be.  BUT, if you are committed to either making or breaking (or both!) any habit you can think of, then this little jewel of an app can help you do that.  The idea of ""streaks"" may seem trivial to some, but we all crave this at some level because it clearly marks out your accomplishments in a tangible way.  When you see you have X days of success, you are that much more likely to overcome the impediments you may face.  What's more, this program is highly flexible in the ways you can track any given habit.  I have yet to find a habit and pattern I couldn't set up.  The app is free, although I paid for the premium version because 1) I HATE ads and 2) I liked the flexibility of data export, so just try it and you may find that it changes your life for the better.",positive
7080,"Near perfect. Considering you only really need a piece of paper on the wall or a calendar to track habits. It does that and more with a clean UI. It also has nice features when you create a habit, download it to see what I mean. Discussion posts are a really nice bonus as well. Overall the app is gold.",positive
7081,First I was skeptical about this app but only a few weeks in and I already see myself adjusting a couple things in my life. Amazing how this works. Thanks guys!,positive
7082,"Easy to use, set up a lot of goals....easy to track.",positive
7083,I bought this great app. Just started using it. I am a procrastinator so I am struggling to meet my goals. I am therefore absolutely relying on this app to help me track my performance. I really like the notifications with the positive words it attributes to me. I like the fact that you can quantify exactly the number or time allocated to the habits and track against that. When I manage to conquer a habit I will write a new review. Cheers,positive
7084,"Just overall a great app if you want to become more concious about your daily habits. And, of course it's very helpful to create new habits / erase unwanted ones ;-) The paid version is gonna be a necessary upgrade if you want to keep track of lots of things, but it's totally worth it!",positive
7085,With the short period of time I've used this app I have enjoyed it. The app has been a great tool to help my keep track of my 2018 goals and stay on top of new habits I am trying to create to better myself and future. it has a clean UI although i wish it had more theme options. This app has been great at motivation on days o have slacked off or days I messed up with its visual aid on my progress for 2019. I would recommend it to someone trying to create a better habits.,positive
7086,"I usually don't write reviews. In fact, this is my first. But this app is worth a few words of appreciation! It works well, is easy to use, and helps me keep track of my activities/habits. It reminds me to too in a non-intrusive way. If you are looking for an app to help build a habit, this app is worth giving a try.",positive
7087,HabitBull is what I was looking for in a habit tracking app. It has a lot of customization for what constitutes a goal streak and a simple overview and data entry screen. I was happy that premium is just a one-time fee. And it's cool to see the posts from other people working on their goals too.,positive
7088,"By far the best habit building and tracking app I have used and I have tried many. Have been using the paid version for 6 months or more and my routines ane habits are the best of my life. You need more than an app, but having a tool like this is KEY. LOVE the flexibility, simplicity and the streak-oriented design. Thank you HabitBull!",positive
7089,"Great app for tracking whatever it is that you want to develop as a regular habit. Clean interface and very easy to set up new habits like exercising on set days, not smoking or taking medicine. The 'streaks' length & percentage success are good motivators and give you a nice visual reference for how well you're doing.",positive
7090,"Simple, no B.S. habit tracking. Forming a habit is hard, and it makes sense to track your progress for multiple reasons. Some apps and methods are almost as hard to use as the habit you are trying to create is to make. Not HabitBull. I've only been using the app for about a week now and it has been painlessly helping me work towards my goals and forge a better self.",positive
7091,"Helped motivate me get back on track after a big downswing. Just the idea of keeping a simple chain going helps so much. I guess it's because it's like a promise to yourself. Decided to get the premium :) It's not expensive either, so I think it's completely worth it. I'm very grateful that someone recommended this app to me when they did.",positive
7092,Great app. Simple and it really helps forming new positive habits. It's amazing what you can do when you just do it consistently.,positive
7093,Easy to set up and edit. I upgraded to premium so I could add more habits.,positive
7094,"This app has helped me get back in track. I started out reading my Bible every three days, and ended reading it every single day. If you are struggling with a bad habit, this is the app for you. I have tried many different habit trackers before, but this has been the best thus far. It shows you your progress percentages too, which is a really cool feature. Highly recommended.",positive
7095,"Any app made well and affective for the needs of the many should be free of limited access and ability, to help them actually acjhieve the goals they have set, like limit 3-5 habits to track...Go PREMIUM and you go for as many goals as you want, hhhmmmm, anyone catching the psychological aspect of limiting a person by a marketing suggestion? It's cool, the app functioms as it should, i t is us as humans that need to work... GodSpeed",positive
7096,"i found that, if i am reloading the app from recent apps it is again asking for the password. quit a nice feature . even some important apps are not having this feature. but say if i am switching to another app while seeing some habit chart. when i see in recent apps, i can clearly see the last viewed chart. it would be nice, if u guys can fix this issue",positive
7097,"I didn't think this app was much at first, but I soon started to get into the swing of things I've been trying to get myself into for the longest time after installing. There's just something about that feeling of satisfaction when you fill in a circle for completing something. It tracks your streaks and your average progress. It also encourages you with cute quotes about being yourself and being the best you! Forming (or breaking) a habit can be done easily with Habit Bull!",positive
7098,"I really like how easy it is to use, that it displays your progress in a neat and easy-to-track way, and gives you options for how to measure your success (yes/no per day, #of days per week, days you want to succeed and days you can 'cheat', etc). It's pretty satisfying to tap the little circle for a thing I did and see it turn green and link up with other days! Would definitely recommend.",positive
7099,App is great! Can set timed reminders to keep going. I like the visual encouragement that this provides for me with trying to stay on track!,positive

7102,"No frills, just what I was looking for",positive
7103,I love this habit app and the customization ootions. I use it to track exercise and also build up/break habits im trying to start/stop.,positive
7104,I have used several habit tracking apps and this one is the best. It is easy to use and I like the way it gives my percentage success rate and my streaks. A lot of the other apps wanted a monthly subscription fee. I paid for the pro version after using the free version since it was a one time payment.,positive

7165,Easy &simple,positive
7166,Good luck,positive
7167,"Great habit tracking app. The only things I think could be improved are: goal dates not automatically pushing back to match the day you edited a habit. And being able to edit how you want to track a habit if you change your mind. Maybe I missed something, but it seems like you have to recreate a habit in order to change how to keep track of it (ex. Yes/No or by keeping count with numbers). I highly recommend this tool though, it's a great place to start keeping track of habits!",positive

Could do with an update and could have other features but what it does (help maintain habit streaks) it does better than any other app I've found. I bought premium one off to use the apps.its worth it for me. Don't usually buy subscriptions but a couple dollars once off worth it. Free to use though, only widgets are premium",positive

7200,"Good app, but does not respect ""do not disturb"" mode and keeps waking me up every night. EDIT: the issue is fixed, giving the deserved 5 stars. EDIT2: this is not fixed, after all. Somehow this app not only not respects the do not disturb mode, but also manages to send notifications one hour after I fell asleep. Today it sounded around 4 am!!!",negative
7201,"Could be good if basic features like icons weren't locked behind a paid subscription. Update: your calling THEMES an advanced feature because you want to not because it is one.... Sorry but changing the background color to black, which it should be in the first place isn't an advanced feature, it's about one line of code. I'm a software engineer myself and know the difference between the two. Same goes for icons which are essentially to app functionality. Check out Notion for a great example.",negative

7203,I just cannot be notified. Please. Fix it. So I could give 5 stars.,negative
7204,Don't offer to send notifications if you won't actually do it. That was the whole reason why I thought this would help me and it didn't. Will be uninstalling.,negative

7207,"Crippled version without even a way to purchase outright. EDIT: I'll be clearer. Many apps features are disabled. But there is no way to just buy the app. The only option is some ongoing payment subscription which makes no sense as this app does not provide any ongoing or backend service, it's just an app! and a simple one at that. It's like going to buy a water bottle and going to check out they take your credit card info and charge you the same price every year that you use the bottle. Bottom line, it's just a scummy business practice.",negative
7208,"Notifications don't work. It's a shame, because I wanted to buy a subscription. [EDIT] Okay, I already know what's going on. The operating system of my smartphone is MIUI. This app's notifications work when the battery saver mode is turned off. At the same time, in the application settings I have the option: ""No restrictions - battery saver doesn't restrict app's activity."" Other applications similar to this one (ToDo, habits) work with this option and at the same time enable battery saving.",negative
7209,It seems the app is not build for longer and more complex use. It looks like it can be used for people that plan to follow and develop their behaviour but the level of this app is of a game. Takes too long for resolving the bugs and no reaction to feedback. App crashes when using the calendar options. This should not happend when using payed version of the app. Waiting for improvement or giving up using and paying for this app.,negative

7366,"This is a re-review. This could be the best habit tracker, goal setter and task manager, with some really great features like nested lists and smart/auto grouping and a very versatile repeat task setup. Just don't confuse the 'game' in RPG for any actual gameplay; but it does have a very elaborate character design and advancement system, that deserves recognition, allowing for a well rounded and unique hero which grows with every task performed in the user's daily life. However Do It Now does hamstring itself by overlooking some very important integral functionality. Firstly there is no way to order the tasks set out in any of the groups. After a solid month of use, building some projects with subtasks which had subtasks, and setting up several habit based routines, the lack of prioritisation or task ordering created a confusing clutter of items which looked no different from the next. While auto-grouping and smart grouping should have been able to help sort that out the lack of ability for the user to remove any task from these groups meant every task appeared, once again losing the important ones in the clutter. User defined groups could only contain the items specifically placed in them- but once again a large project with a number of different aspects can not be ordered into a sensible linear series.. With no social aspect currently attached to the app (as at ver 2.23.0) there is no task sharing. There is also no designated pc/mac/linux front end for desktop syncing. Finally it's expensive as apps go. A one off of $75 will get the full version, or about $2.50 a month (paid yearly), which removes ads and gives calendar access. Original review: ""A good way to make the tedium of self regulation a bit more fun. Being able to plan to skip things when away from regular activities is handy. It would be nice to see characteristic and skill based modifiers affect related task improvements as they raise and subtask attached leader.""",neutral
7367,Good app and I like the setups that are already prepared for when u log in. My problem with the app is that it's too overwhelming. Too many things to manage and for my easily distracted and anxious brain it's too much. As constructive that can actually be applied--please make it so the tasks actually leave the list ocne they are completed. Some are infinite and its difficult to focus on what needs to be done. Otherwise. Good job on this app it's well made.,neutral
7368,"I used to use Habitica, and I must say this is a great step up. I'd like to see more social features, such as sharing tasks - only one person has to perform said task for it to be checked off, but only giving that person the experience and gold. Otherwise, the price for subscription is too steep, thus resulting in a sub-perfect score. I could easily justify $0.99/month or eternal subscription for $15. If that price could be met, as well as fine tuning, this would be easily worth 5 stars.",neutral
7369,"I like the idea how it shows my skills but I hate it when it organize the tasks in orders, it sets up automatically wherever it wants. Manual task organizer should be available.",neutral
7370,"The app is great for the most part, i just wish that the 'notification option' for tasks would actually alert me. No alarm or even a pop-up message. I got this to help me remember to take care of certain things due to memory issues, but it's not gonna be of any help if i can't even remember i have the app. Please fix the alarm notification system.",neutral
7371,"Was really looking for an app that lets me have multiple repeats for a task within the same day, everyday. Duplicating a task multiple times and then making those into subtasks seems to be the only way, but it clutters up the task list (like 8 lines so I'm reminded to drink 8 glasses of water) and then subtasks show up twice in the daily list, both within and outside of the main task. I thought the ""repeat every 1 day, 8 times"" custom setting might work, but it's a different function.",neutral

7377,"It's a good start...I currently have a 1 month subscription. Needs more habit type features. Needs to track , display and keep a record of current and longest streaks. Repeat option needs much more options like; 1. A way to track a task that's done a certain number of times a day like 3 times a day. 2. Repeat week, should also have the option to have the task done a certain amount of days not just on specific days. 3. Achievements should have an option for completing consecutive days.",neutral
7378,"This app could be five stars to me. what is stopping me is the confusion on knowing just what tasks to do or not to do. There's a confusing list of tasks that show up at the bottom and if I did not do them the day before or not click them, they just show up there. If I delete a task from the calendar on accident what do I do? the calendar should be completely removed cuz it's worthless. I think tasks should have some sort of streak function or show how many times you have done it in a row.",neutral

7380,The fact there are no predefined tasks makes it super hard to use. Or rather this will work if user can just define the task (quest) easily.

7391,"It's not bad. But it seems greedy. Like, why do I have to pay to unlock individual color themes if I'm paying a monthly subscription? Also, LifeRPG was so much better than this. More icons to choose from and they were free. If you're going to make an app that copies all the ideas from LifeRPG, at least make it better.

7394,"overall a really good app. well thought. however, I would personally spend some time on the interface/interactions. it became too many steps for my preferences. realizing I needed to change a bunch of tasks, I had to pick a task, bottom right to edit, then tap below description, untick termless, select date, click ok top right, another ok top right. that's too much. I suggest adding swiping options to the task (look at nine email as an example). but overall good. might return one day :)",neutral
7395,"A decent app for its intents and purposes but I struggle to stay invested. It's visually good, great icons and colours, also has a nice selection of skills. My biggest issue is the navigation. I can't immediately see or twirl down to see subtasks.

Perhaps a mind map or something would make it easier.",neutral

7445,"I like the idea how it shows my skills but I hate it when it organize the tasks in orders, it sets up automatically wherever it wants. Manual task organizer should be available.",neutral
7446,"This is a re-review. This could be the best habit tracker, goal setter and task manager, with some really great features like nested lists and smart/auto grouping and a very versatile repeat task setup. Just don't confuse the 'game' in RPG for any actual gameplay; but it does have a very elaborate character design and advancement system, that deserves recognition, allowing for a well rounded and unique hero which grows with every task performed in the user's daily life. However Do It Now does hamstring itself by overlooking some very important integral functionality. Firstly there is no way to order the tasks set out in any of the groups. After a solid month of use, building some projects with subtasks which had subtasks, and setting up several habit based routines, the lack of prioritisation or task ordering created a confusing clutter of items which looked no different from the next. While auto-grouping and smart grouping should have been able to help sort that out the lack of ability for the user to remove any task from these groups meant every task appeared, once again losing the important ones in the clutter. User defined groups could only contain the items specifically placed in them- but once again a large project with a number of different aspects can not be ordered into a sensible linear series.. With no social aspect currently attached to the app (as at ver 2.23.0) there is no task sharing. There is also no designated pc/mac/linux front end for desktop syncing. Finally it's expensive as apps go. A one off of $75 will get the full version, or about $2.50 a month (paid yearly), which removes ads and gives calendar access. Original review: ""A good way to make the tedium of self regulation a bit more fun. Being able to plan to skip things when away from regular activities is handy. It would be nice to see characteristic and skill based modifiers affect related task improvements as they raise and subtask attached leader.""",neutral
7447,"I used to use Habitica, and I must say this is a great step up. I'd like to see more social features, such as sharing tasks - only one person has to perform said task for it to be checked off, but only giving that person the experience and gold. Otherwise, the price for subscription is too steep, thus resulting in a sub-perfect score. I could easily justify $0.99/month or eternal subscription for $15. If that price could be met, as well as fine tuning, this would be easily worth 5 stars.",neutral

I will reach level 100 in benchpress by the time i can do 150kg, completing 120kg would put me on level 70 etc.  Otherwise the numbers are just meaningless to me.

7523,"This is a great app for anybody needing some extra motivation or a way to organize their life. I've had some trouble editing or deleting reoccurring tasks, but this may be a device issue, I'm not sure.",positive
7524,"I am liking it, the subscription model is a bit steep and harsh, especially for the full buy out at 50+ dollars. A suggestion, I'd like to see two categories under the ""Skills"", one that says ""Increasing"" and one that says ""Decreasing"". I am trying to set up a ""Daily Grind"" negative skill that decreases ""Will Power"" and ""Motivation"", while increasing ""Submission"" and ""Routine"". I've noticed the Dev team is really good at responding, so I am hopeful for a response. Thanks!",positive
7525,"The app is good and in general highly customizable, but it has one flaw: it uses days (24 hours periods) as a basic unit of measure, but it doesn't let you change the default starting hour (midnight). This is inconvenient for people who have unusual working hours and it makes the app impractical to track daily tasks for users who are more productive at night. I would rate it as a 5 stars app, if I could choose when my day ends and be able to log my dailies properly.",positive
7526,"This app is great! I love the idea of turning my daily life like an RPG game. But I have this goal to wash my face twice everyday and it feels repetitive to make two task for the exact same thing. So can you guys make a task where it has to be done twice before the said task is completed? Been trying my hardest to do this on your app, even finished reading the user guide, but it still wouldn't work.",positive
7527,"The app is allready great. The amount of customisation is surreal and with a bit of tweaking you can really make it work. The sentimental value you create this way really helped me grow. As the app is rpg themed, those elements could be further enhanced imo. I think a customisable character would be fun. More options to spend the currency other then personalised awards is what im getting at. This way you really build something with the effort you've put in. For the games.. Keep up the good work",positive
7528,"I like this app, but it really annoys me that it defaults to playing a chime when you first pick up your phone in the morning. When just checking the time, I don't want to be woken up even more. I wish it were possible to just disable that notification instead of disabling all sounds from the app at once.",positive
7529,Works as expected but I would like for time customisation to be more flexible and precise,positive
7530,"It is a cool app, but the calendar feature required to be bought. That should be informed to the users before installation. In addition, it would be a good idea if skills can increase over time, and skills can decrease characteristics.",positive

7532,I really like it. I think it's a really cool concept to have characters to build up with the habits. Only thing I wish were there is to be able to have notifications for term less habits,positive

7538,"Add ""negative habits"" which when done decrease coin, xp etc.",positive
7539,Homescreen widget would be nice with more display option such as the progress bar.. etc,positive
7540,"I just started but really like it so far. Competes directly with Habitica but less of the nonsense costumes. It's hard at first to sort characteristics, skills and tasks (you are essentially your own game dev) but on paper I recently sorted out what I want to improve (Skills) and what is stopping me (Characteristics). Tasks will follow soon after. I'm really hopeful about this setup, I love the design, and I never do this but I might actually pay for a subscription (!!!) if all goes well.",positive
7541,"Perfect for people who want to get organized and desire an app more robust than a checklist. It has profound customization ability. The reward system is more complex than competitors. For someone with significant attention issues, this has really helped me to feel invested. Subtasks and autofails are great features. Would be 5 stars if developers: 1. Allowed subtasks to renew as collapsible tasks not just tied in 2. Made tutorial/videos. Full functionality will be a learning curve for many",positive
7542,Just after I looked at the interface I knew it was what I was searching. Not so for the xp thing which is a very great idea but also how it handle goals like reading books... For anyone who think in terms of goals (and obviously who love RPGs) It's totally free though,positive
7543,"Interesting concept! Still getting used to the functionality, but this app is an effective way to gamify your to-do and task lists. Before Do it Now -RPG, I had a list of chores; Now I have a quest-list, instead. Time to go unlock some achievements!",positive
7544,Great honestly great way to keep track of daily tasks to stay organized. One thing they should add is overall goals. And tasks leading to those goals.,positive

7547,Looking forward to a better UI/UX. Will keep using it.,positive
7548,"I was looking for an organizer app which would provide statistics on my discipline and progress, and this does it! But it is missing one, to me basic, feature - the tasks don't have a start time or duration period, there is only a deadline. It doesn't allow understanding easily whether the tasks overlap in time. Is this feature available in the premium version at least? Another missing feature is the location setting, at least at a home/work/outdoors level. Any plans to incorporate the features?",positive
7549,Its a good app for everyday tasks. It takes time to customize it and its normal because its an RPG type. However I think im not the only one who encountered this annoying bug where if you want to change a task from lets say termless to always repeat every day the task remains termless. You can solve this problem by deleting the task and making another with the setting you want. This bug was very frustrating because i thought i did something wrong but yeah..,positive
7550,"It's helpful, but it's also annoying. Edit: I didn't make it clear enough, it's annoying to realize how much I'm failing lol Anyway the app is pretty good I'm just overly sensitive and self criritcal",positive
7551,"It's pretty nice all things considered, but I have found a few problems with it. mostly the fact that the notifications do not work and by that I mean no matter how many notify alarms I set, none of them go off. I've downloaded this app on several occasions in the past and I've had the same problems each time. The second is that the widget will (quite often) display that I have no tasks when I in fact have about seven on any given day. I'm not taking a star off because of the widget though.",positive
7552,"Good concept. But I don't use the app anymore. as someone who is now not really a gamer, the point game-like concept seems to doesn't work for me anymore and maybe it's also due to the fact that I only compete with my self. if I were to compete with a friend or whoever that is, maybe I can keep my self accountable. But that's it to it. If you are a gamer, this app might gonna help you.",positive
7553,"It's a great app, keep up the good work! It has almost all features I've ever wished for in gamification. But a few things were missing/quite annoying for me and lead me to abandon this app for now. If it helps you I could write you a comprehensive list of enhancements and features that I think could make this app better. Here's not enough space for that, though. Please give a short answer of you'd like me to send you an email with the list of my thoughts. :)",positive
7554,"Looks cool and I like the stats. I would like to have a monthly and yearly calendar display on which dates with non-repeating tasks scheduled are bold or otherwise highlighted, or preferably have the tasks listed in small font in the box for that day in monthly view. And when you click on the date have all tasks for that day display. Why do none of the life rpg apps I've tried not have calendars? It's bothersome to add something to a calendar and then open up another app and add it in again.",positive
7555,"You add execution note but when I check in history it just one word that appeared, and the next is ........, I confuse how to check the details. Hope the next update, there is detail preview when tap a mission that's done in history. And also search feature in history will be very useful to check some mission among all those missions in history. Thank you for great app.",positive
7556,"I downloaded this game in the Hope's that the format would help me with my procrastination and can I just say, its exceeded my expectations. it's so good ! I ended up having to change some of the pre set tasks and rewards to make it more personalized but apart from that, it's great. highly recommend if you, like me, like to procrastinate and make excuses to avoid tasks.",positive
7557,So far so good. I love creating my own adventure. Still learning some of the functions. Maybe a tips video could help. I can't wait to see what other fun things can be added. More community or friends list. Or leader board. Then get us to do in app purchases for new items or level streaks. I just like this a bunch. So thank you!,positive
7558,"A very good rip-off of LifeRPG—taking all of the useful features of task management, reward motivation, and RPG-style stat levels, and making the UI simpler and more user-friendly. Seems to be monetizing the idea though, putting in ads and lots of in-app purchases and requiring a RECURRING payment subscription rather than one-time purchase to unlock features",positive
7559,Notifications fixed. App keeps getting better. I'd like to suggest being able to use habit generation as an unlock condition for achievements. Edit: Nice :D Another thing I would suggest is add the date when an achievement was unlocked (example: unlocked 01/04/2019) so we can also order them by this date when looking the unlocked tab. Thanks for this app!,positive
7560,"This app is really good. I want to suggest to that the app should have a ""Rest Day"" option or something similar. That you can activate it anytime you want and while activated, the tasks will be put into a halt including penalty and overdue. It is useful if you are on vacation or there's an occasion you need to attend and makes you unable to finish the daily tasks.",positive
7561,Fantastic app but 4 stars. Every part has been a comfortable experience for me until I started trying to use it across devices. I took me around 30 minutes to set up all my tasks the first time and when I signed into my account for the app all the tasks I had made got overwritten by the default tasks from the other device. It was partially my fault for the careless order that I signed in on the devices. But perhaps my issue could have been avoided entirely if when it attempted to sync my tasks from the internet the first time it asked me if I wanted to use the database that is from the internet or that is local. Would have saved me a lot of headache remaking all the tasks again. That said every other function provided is great and I would recommend.,positive
7562,"Pretty good, only issue I noticed is that if you undo claiming a reward that has its price increase each claim it can give you extra coins back. Aside from that, a lifetime purchase option would be nice (I try to avoid subscriptions where possible, so I'm sticking with using this for free for now), and an option to hide the parts that require a subscription instead of showing them but asking you to pay when you click them would be nice. (e.g. so the calendar doesn't even show up on the bottom).",positive
7563,"I've been using this app for some weeks now. There are still some features that I don't understand and there's just so much available for customisation that it's overwhelming. But, once i spent a few hours customizing all i wanted, this app has been so fun and useful. Most to do list apps out there are so cumbersome and anxiety inducing. This one isn't. It has helped me prioritize what's important to me while letting me role-play. I like it a lot.",positive
7564,I like this app. I only used it for 5 mins and there are no adverts that ruin your experience. I hope that the developers will continue working on it so that the app will be improved. I would consider paying for the premium features too if the app is good enough.,positive
7565,"Productivity gamefied! As has been said before, the natural successor to LifeRPG. Looks like they just ripped the source code tbh, but it irons out many of its predecessors bugs. Pity they monetised it in every available orifice, fukugly full screen ads, in-app purchases for trivial customisations and an absurdly extortionate subscription, all conspire to overshadow the app itself, as does the uninspired graphic design and the use of unexciting headings that detract from its ""gaming"" USP.",positive
7566,"New user and I'm impressed! A lot of neat features I've been looking for in apps like this. it's obvious dev is active and listening and thats a great sign. If I have an immediate suggestion, it'd be for us to be able to add tab categories of traits besides the default characteristics/skills; for example to add things like ""personality"", ""lifestyle"" or however we want to organize our skillset categories, so those 2 sections aren't cluttered. A search option for icons too maybe? Keep it up!",positive
7567,"I bought the full version. its a fun app to challenge yourself. I would like to see an update gives you the choice to choose a pen or pencil icon or a book icon, which seem to be missing, that would be useful. for example, if you want to write a book, it would be nice to have a ""book""📚📗📘📙📓📔icon, or ""pen""🖋🖊 icon, or ""pencil"" icon... UPDATE: I seem them now! Thanks for responding and letting me know. Looks like I needed to scroll farther down to see them. 👍",positive
7568,This app looks to carry the torch from the now abandoned LifeRPG app and from a bit of digging so far I'm impressed. Some things are tucked behind a pay wall such as the calendar and aesthetic additions like themes and icons but it's a relatively low price and helps support the devs so I'll probably bite on that once I've set up everything and used the app a bit. One suggestion I'd have is to implement geotagged triggers for events - like bringing up a reminder when I'm near the gym or store.,positive
7569,"(+)Pros: it's fun, LOTS of customisation, ALL basic functionality are free, inclined to habit generation than everyday to do list. (-)Cons: first time setup are quite challenging; literally create your own system. Icons & themes are limited (minor inconvenience). I was using LifeRPG (which seems abandoned now) so it helps with the learning curve. I see devs made lots improvement here. Recommended!",positive
7570,"Great app for setting up to do list and setting skills, very similar to LifeRPG, differing only in UI and the addition of achievements in my opinion. Stuck with the other one of the basis of not wanting to pay a subscription for an app. Would prefer one off payment to unlock features.",positive
7571,"It's a good app but can be better I want the developer to fix the following please: 1-when you work with it sometimes it becomes laggy and you need to force stop and restart the app 2-when you type in it in Persian the symbols like ""?, (,), etc"" doesn't align correctly 3 - if you add some native calendars like Persian calendar to it it will become more useful (and also an option to set it as main calendar not like Google alternative calendars that show Gregorian months not Persian months ex.)",positive
7572,this is pure magic juat saying best life app out there keep up the great work!!! im ao happy you listen to your customers EDIT: now my entire household is using this app its amazing magic easy to use only thing i noticed is that when you claim a reward if it has an increasing cost sometimes it will spend the gold after the increase instead of before resulting in extra gold loss my best guess is that the script might be changing the cost value before subtracting the gold from the players gold.,positive
7573,"A good app in general. I would love to be able to have ""loose"" tasks, for example: practice spanish twice a week. Which should be completed at least twice every week. Also, why not allow icons to be any emoji?",positive
7574,"I like this app enough to have paid for a year's subscription, but there are a couple quality of life improvements that would be nice. I would love to see icons on the widget. I would also like to pick icons as my avatar photo since there's some good ones.",positive
7575,"It's a bit hard to set everything up, but it's a fun new concept for the typical agenda that encourages you a bit more to achieve your goals through a rpg style. Nice work dev team. Thanks for your time and effort.",positive
7576,"one thing, the widget sometimes doesn't update the today list, and about the to do list, i have to make 2 different widget for today and tommorow, because when all tasks show, cannot differentiate what today and tommorow so i was check list my today and tommorow task, and it is kinda confusing how to uncheck again (?) maybe this option to check and uncheck must be there, and the reward will be given after all the task has done for today.. thank you, hope this app improve",positive
7577,Fun way to track and reward yourself guilt-free. Lots of personal calibration but the interface is nice. My only problem is the lack of icons even in the premium section.,positive
7578,"It's a lot of fun, good personalization. I have to make time to explore the app called more fully, I think a tutorial would be amazing, and pre-developed lists that could be tweaked.",positive
7579,"it would be nice if there are pre-set goals or task to choose from - while the app allow for a high level of customization, it's too much hassle to set it all up properly, not to mention balancing the reward from each task",positive

But i really need a list functional, like add a shopping list or some book list to add in this app. Are you going to add this?

7589,It٬s one of the best liferpg apps i have ever seen with lot of options but it can have some more beautiful transparent widgets and if you add an option that a task directly influences a characteristics it can be more comfortable,positive
7590,"This app is great overall, I just wish there were categories for your inventory items and that the task list widget showed your profile icon also, the profile icon has very bad quality when you choose your own :/",positive

7592,"I like it, and I would definitely pay £20 for it, but I cant justify paying a subscription. if only I could pay once.",positive
7593,"Liking it a lot so far, but I don't get it doesn't give a warning ring before tasks I put in. That's kind of the main thing I need it for - to remind me of tasks I had previously put in.",positive
7594,"Hello. This app is great, but I have a suggestion. With the inventory items, please make it so you can give them attribites such as +10% xp gain or +10% gold gain, or just +10% xp for a specific skill.",positive
7595,This would have been a 5 star to app if it wasnt for one miner problem I didn't like. You can't choose PM or AM times and it's just a annoying and confusing.,positive

More options to spend the currency other then personalised awards is what im getting at. This way you really build something with the effort you've put in. For the games.. Keep up the good work",positive
7642,"This app is great! I love the idea of turning my daily life like an RPG game. But I have this goal to wash my face twice everyday and it feels repetitive to make two task for the exact same thing. So can you guys make a task where it has to be done twice before the said task is completed? Been trying my hardest to do this on your app, even finished reading the user guide, but it still wouldn't work.",positive
7643,I really like it. I think it's a really cool concept to have characters to build up with the habits. Only thing I wish were there is to be able to have notifications for term less habits,positive
7644,"The app is good and in general highly customizable, but it has one flaw: it uses days (24 hours periods) as a basic unit of measure, but it doesn't let you change the default starting hour (midnight). This is inconvenient for people who have unusual working hours and it makes the app impractical to track daily tasks for users who are more productive at night. I would rate it as a 5 stars app, if I could choose when my day ends and be able to log my dailies properly.",positive
7645,Turn life into a game! Create your own tasks and assign value to them! Pretty cool eh?,positive
7646,"Nice. Will be better if app has got inhabit counter.. for example count of pushups or exercise. I need it, but app is very nice. I will be recommend it.",positive
7647,"It is a cool app, but the calendar feature required to be bought. That should be informed to the users before installation. In addition, it would be a good idea if skills can increase over time, and skills can decrease characteristics.",positive
7648,Great honestly great way to keep track of daily tasks to stay organized. One thing they should add is overall goals. And tasks leading to those goals.,positive
7649,"Interesting concept! Still getting used to the functionality, but this app is an effective way to gamify your to-do and task lists. Before Do it Now -RPG, I had a list of chores; Now I have a quest-list, instead. Time to go unlock some achievements!",positive
7650,"This app is so robust, I love it! However, I would love a quick add button in the notifications.",positive
7651,"I just started but really like it so far. Competes directly with Habitica but less of the nonsense costumes. It's hard at first to sort characteristics, skills and tasks (you are essentially your own game dev) but on paper I recently sorted out what I want to improve (Skills) and what is stopping me (Characteristics). Tasks will follow soon after. I'm really hopeful about this setup, I love the design, and I never do this but I might actually pay for a subscription (!!!) if all goes well.",positive
7652,"Perfect for people who want to get organized and desire an app more robust than a checklist. It has profound customization ability. The reward system is more complex than competitors. For someone with significant attention issues, this has really helped me to feel invested. Subtasks and autofails are great features. Would be 5 stars if developers: 1. Allowed subtasks to renew as collapsible tasks not just tied in 2. Made tutorial/videos. Full functionality will be a learning curve for many",positive
7653,Looking forward to a better UI/UX. Will keep using it.,positive
7654,Just after I looked at the interface I knew it was what I was searching. Not so for the xp thing which is a very great idea but also how it handle goals like reading books... For anyone who think in terms of goals (and obviously who love RPGs) It's totally free though,positive
7655,Its a good app for everyday tasks. It takes time to customize it and its normal because its an RPG type. However I think im not the only one who encountered this annoying bug where if you want to change a task from lets say termless to always repeat every day the task remains termless. You can solve this problem by deleting the task and making another with the setting you want. This bug was very frustrating because i thought i did something wrong but yeah..,positive
7656,COMPLETE! A tip: The task option directly reduces the characteristics rather than just the ability,positive
7657,"I would love to do a one/life time purchase for this app. Too bad I hate subscription based so sorry, I'd rather spend my money for something unproductive than this app.",positive
7658,"I was looking for an organizer app which would provide statistics on my discipline and progress, and this does it! But it is missing one, to me basic, feature - the tasks don't have a start time or duration period, there is only a deadline. It doesn't allow understanding easily whether the tasks overlap in time. Is this feature available in the premium version at least? Another missing feature is the location setting, at least at a home/work/outdoors level. Any plans to incorporate the features?",positive
7659,The app has a way of motivating you to complete tasks.,positive
7660,It keeps reminding me even after the Task is done and it was adjusted according to how many times I should be notified. But overall nice app.,positive
7661,Treating activities like a game Gives me a sense of accomplishment when I successfully finish my duties and earn XP.,positive
7662,"Awesome app to keep your life on track. Would 5 star, but app crashes every time I try and add a custoum sound. Edit: Thank you! Will try again after the next update.",positive
7663,"I've been using this app for some weeks now. There are still some features that I don't understand and there's just so much available for customisation that it's overwhelming. But, once i spent a few hours customizing all i wanted, this app has been so fun and useful. Most to do list apps out there are so cumbersome and anxiety inducing. This one isn't. It has helped me prioritize what's important to me while letting me role-play. I like it a lot.",positive
7664,"It's a good app but can be better I want the developer to fix the following please: 1-when you work with it sometimes it becomes laggy and you need to force stop and restart the app 2-when you type in it in Persian the symbols like ""?, (,), etc"" doesn't align correctly 3 - if you add some native calendars like Persian calendar to it it will become more useful (and also an option to set it as main calendar not like Google alternative calendars that show Gregorian months not Persian months ex.)",positive
7665,"Pretty easy to use and reliable. Still trying to figure out the ins and outs, but it's been fairly easy to pick up.",positive
7666,Good,positive
7667,The apps are functioning well and recommended trying for RPG theme if you love RPG 👍but there is a problem where sometimes when i added the task it does not appear at the task section and sometimes it becomes duplicate..,positive
7668,Very interesting application just to complicated for me,positive
7669,"(+)Pros: it's fun, LOTS of customisation, ALL basic functionality are free, inclined to habit generation than everyday to do list. (-)Cons: first time setup are quite challenging; literally create your own system. Icons & themes are limited (minor inconvenience). I was using LifeRPG (which seems abandoned now) so it helps with the learning curve. I see devs made lots improvement here. Recommended!",positive
7670,"Hello. This app is great, but I have a suggestion. With the inventory items, please make it so you can give them attribites such as +10% xp gain or +10% gold gain, or just +10% xp for a specific skill.",positive
7671,Nice,positive
7672,This app looks to carry the torch from the now abandoned LifeRPG app and from a bit of digging so far I'm impressed. Some things are tucked behind a pay wall such as the calendar and aesthetic additions like themes and icons but it's a relatively low price and helps support the devs so I'll probably bite on that once I've set up everything and used the app a bit. One suggestion I'd have is to implement geotagged triggers for events - like bringing up a reminder when I'm near the gym or store.,positive
7673,Jibj,positive
7674,"it would be nice if there are pre-set goals or task to choose from - while the app allow for a high level of customization, it's too much hassle to set it all up properly, not to mention balancing the reward from each task",positive
7675,It٬s one of the best liferpg apps i have ever seen with lot of options but it can have some more beautiful transparent widgets and if you add an option that a task directly influences a characteristics it can be more comfortable,positive
7676,"definetly a 4 star. good app, good concepts some bugs, not really pulling me in thou. i forgot about it, which was sort of the point of the app to make me not forget it. so 4 stars.",positive
7677,fun and productive,positive
7678,"Pretty good, only issue I noticed is that if you undo claiming a reward that has its price increase each claim it can give you extra coins back. Aside from that, a lifetime purchase option would be nice (I try to avoid subscriptions where possible, so I'm sticking with using this for free for now), and an option to hide the parts that require a subscription instead of showing them but asking you to pay when you click them would be nice. (e.g. so the calendar doesn't even show up on the bottom).",positive
7679,"I bought the full version. its a fun app to challenge yourself. I would like to see an update gives you the choice to choose a pen or pencil icon or a book icon, which seem to be missing, that would be useful. for example, if you want to write a book, it would be nice to have a ""book""📚📗📘📙📓📔icon, or ""pen""🖋🖊 icon, or ""pencil"" icon... UPDATE: I seem them now! Thanks for responding and letting me know. Looks like I needed to scroll farther down to see them. 👍",positive
7680,easy to use and good at keeping me motivated throughout the day,positive
7681,Crashes when I customize my hero status,positive
7682,"I downloaded this game in the Hope's that the format would help me with my procrastination and can I just say, its exceeded my expectations. it's so good ! I ended up having to change some of the pre set tasks and rewards to make it more personalized but apart from that, it's great. highly recommend if you, like me, like to procrastinate and make excuses to avoid tasks.",positive
7683,"I like this app enough to have paid for a year's subscription, but there are a couple quality of life improvements that would be nice. I would love to see icons on the widget. I would also like to pick icons as my avatar photo since there's some good ones.",positive
7684,"Its really useful i really wish it had a way to add people so you could submit tasks for eachother, or a way to access it on a computer or browser.",positive
7685,"It's a lot of fun, good personalization. I have to make time to explore the app called more fully, I think a tutorial would be amazing, and pre-developed lists that could be tweaked.",positive
7686,Fantastic app but 4 stars. Every part has been a comfortable experience for me until I started trying to use it across devices. I took me around 30 minutes to set up all my tasks the first time and when I signed into my account for the app all the tasks I had made got overwritten by the default tasks from the other device. It was partially my fault for the careless order that I signed in on the devices. But perhaps my issue could have been avoided entirely if when it attempted to sync my tasks from the internet the first time it asked me if I wanted to use the database that is from the internet or that is local. Would have saved me a lot of headache remaking all the tasks again. That said every other function provided is great and I would recommend.,positive
7687,"New user and I'm impressed! A lot of neat features I've been looking for in apps like this. it's obvious dev is active and listening and thats a great sign. If I have an immediate suggestion, it'd be for us to be able to add tab categories of traits besides the default characteristics/skills; for example to add things like ""personality"", ""lifestyle"" or however we want to organize our skillset categories, so those 2 sections aren't cluttered. A search option for icons too maybe? Keep it up!",positive
7688,"Life changing app with a great concept, but still needs some work.",positive
7689,"Liking it a lot so far, but I don't get it doesn't give a warning ring before tasks I put in. That's kind of the main thing I need it for - to remind me of tasks I had previously put in.",positive
7690,Fun and easy to use. Creative and helpful way to track tasks and habits.,positive
7691,"one thing, the widget sometimes doesn't update the today list, and about the to do list, i have to make 2 different widget for today and tommorow, because when all tasks show, cannot differentiate what today and tommorow so i was check list my today and tommorow task, and it is kinda confusing how to uncheck again (?) maybe this option to check and uncheck must be there, and the reward will be given after all the task has done for today.. thank you, hope this app improve",positive
7692,I can't sign in neither with my google account nor with gmail. should I do something to be able to do that? or it's just a bug?,positive
7693,"i really like the app, but I don't know if I'm using it to its fullest potential. Has any on made a tutorial?",positive
7694,Simple and straightforward,positive
7695,"This app is really good. I want to suggest to that the app should have a ""Rest Day"" option or something similar. That you can activate it anytime you want and while activated, the tasks will be put into a halt including penalty and overdue. It is useful if you are on vacation or there's an occasion you need to attend and makes you unable to finish the daily tasks.",positive
7696,this is pure magic juat saying best life app out there keep up the great work!!! im ao happy you listen to your customers EDIT: now my entire household is using this app its amazing magic easy to use only thing i noticed is that when you claim a reward if it has an increasing cost sometimes it will spend the gold after the increase instead of before resulting in extra gold loss my best guess is that the script might be changing the cost value before subtracting the gold from the players gold.,positive
7697,"Hello! Your app is amazing! My GF and me installed this app 2 days ago and started to planning task to each other. But i really need a list functional, like add a shopping list or some book list to add in this app. Are you going to add this? Sry for my English, btw:) UPDATE: And i really need a functional to add a checklist in tasks with possibility to mark it's completed. Thank you and your team again for this great app!",positive
7698,"It's a bit hard to set everything up, but it's a fun new concept for the typical agenda that encourages you a bit more to achieve your goals through a rpg style. Nice work dev team. Thanks for your time and effort.",positive
7699,eu daria 5 se estivesse totalmente traduzido para português,positive
7700,"This app is great overall, I just wish there were categories for your inventory items and that the task list widget showed your profile icon also, the profile icon has very bad quality when you choose your own :/",positive
7701,Keeps me on track!,positive
7702,Tells me tomorrows activities are overdue today,positive
7703,"I like it, and I would definitely pay £20 for it, but I cant justify paying a subscription. if only I could pay once.",positive
7704,"All it needs is the option to set a pic from the gallery as an icon. If that happens in the next update, I'll give 5 stars!",positive
7705,Notifications fixed. App keeps getting better. I'd like to suggest being able to use habit generation as an unlock condition for achievements. Edit: Nice :D Another thing I would suggest is add the date when an achievement was unlocked (example: unlocked 01/04/2019) so we can also order them by this date when looking the unlocked tab. Thanks for this app!,positive
7706,"Great app for setting up to do list and setting skills, very similar to LifeRPG, differing only in UI and the addition of achievements in my opinion. Stuck with the other one of the basis of not wanting to pay a subscription for an app. Would prefer one off payment to unlock features.",positive
7707,needs more ranks.,positive
7708,"Productivity gamefied! As has been said before, the natural successor to LifeRPG. Looks like they just ripped the source code tbh, but it irons out many of its predecessors bugs. Pity they monetised it in every available orifice, fukugly full screen ads, in-app purchases for trivial customisations and an absurdly extortionate subscription, all conspire to overshadow the app itself, as does the uninspired graphic design and the use of unexciting headings that detract from its ""gaming"" USP.",positive
7709,"A good app in general. I would love to be able to have ""loose"" tasks, for example: practice spanish twice a week. Which should be completed at least twice every week. Also, why not allow icons to be any emoji?",positive
7710,"It's pretty nice all things considered, but I have found a few problems with it. mostly the fact that the notifications do not work and by that I mean no matter how many notify alarms I set, none of them go off. I've downloaded this app on several occasions in the past and I've had the same problems each time. The second is that the widget will (quite often) display that I have no tasks when I in fact have about seven on any given day. I'm not taking a star off because of the widget though.",positive
7711,"It's a great app, keep up the good work! It has almost all features I've ever wished for in gamification. But a few things were missing/quite annoying for me and lead me to abandon this app for now. If it helps you I could write you a comprehensive list of enhancements and features that I think could make this app better. Here's not enough space for that, though. Please give a short answer of you'd like me to send you an email with the list of my thoughts. :)",positive
7712,"I liked the app very much, I signed up and so with the hope that my to do list would sync with all devices. But when I reinstalled the up after cleaning my phone, everything disappeared. 😢",positive
7713,"No bad habits to simply punish me, just could make good habits?",positive
7714,"Looks cool and I like the stats. I would like to have a monthly and yearly calendar display on which dates with non-repeating tasks scheduled are bold or otherwise highlighted, or preferably have the tasks listed in small font in the box for that day in monthly view. And when you click on the date have all tasks for that day display. Why do none of the life rpg apps I've tried not have calendars? It's bothersome to add something to a calendar and then open up another app and add it in again.",positive
7715,So far so good. I love creating my own adventure. Still learning some of the functions. Maybe a tips video could help. I can't wait to see what other fun things can be added. More community or friends list. Or leader board. Then get us to do in app purchases for new items or level streaks. I just like this a bunch. So thank you!,positive
7716,great app reasanable pro features please add multibe avatars(for the kids),positive
7717,"Seems like a very good idea but how can i edit what i've done the previous day? Eg. If its Tuesday, it seems to be impossible to edit achievements from Monday (which seems like a perfect thing do to on Tuesday morning ;) )",positive
7718,"A very good rip-off of LifeRPG—taking all of the useful features of task management, reward motivation, and RPG-style stat levels, and making the UI simpler and more user-friendly. Seems to be monetizing the idea though, putting in ads and lots of in-app purchases and requiring a RECURRING payment subscription rather than one-time purchase to unlock features",positive
7719,"Good concept. But I don't use the app anymore. as someone who is now not really a gamer, the point game-like concept seems to doesn't work for me anymore and maybe it's also due to the fact that I only compete with my self. if I were to compete with a friend or whoever that is, maybe I can keep my self accountable. But that's it to it. If you are a gamer, this app might gonna help you.",positive
7720,This would have been a 5 star to app if it wasnt for one miner problem I didn't like. You can't choose PM or AM times and it's just a annoying and confusing.,positive
7721,I like this app. I only used it for 5 mins and there are no adverts that ruin your experience. I hope that the developers will continue working on it so that the app will be improved. I would consider paying for the premium features too if the app is good enough.,positive
7722,"I've tried several RPG To-Do lists, but this one is the best out of them all. It contains all of the features you need to motivate yourself to get off your butt and do something in your life, especially during this period of quarantine. Read the user guide in settings after installing to understand how it works, and get to it! A big Thanks to developer for their quick responses.",positive
7723,"Great app if you keep it to a short list of achievable habits, fun to use, good statistics for tracking progress, you can input things retroactively if you forget at the time, has dark theme, customization options when it comes to tasks, skills, and characteristics. Lightweight, easy to use. Overall I don't think I have any complaints, it delivers what if says it does well, no more, no less. Tldr: love it.",positive
7724,"I am a vanilla habitician, but that game failed to serve it's purpose several times and I eventually quit. I linked it to several systemic errors. I was even thinking about creating my own habit rpg free of those but then I found Do It Now. Not only it answers all of my concerns it even adds more features, like drawbacks for completing certain tasks (anti-procrastinator) or putting player in position where he has to maintain his characteristics. Amazing, thank you devs. Please port it to web.",positive
7725,"I LOVE this app. I've always had a hard time with planners because I just couldn't see the point, but that allows me to plan and have fun. I feel like I'm constantly playing a video game, but the main character is me! It has definitely improved my life! Thanks a ton, developers!",positive
7726,"This is by far the most useful and customisable Gamify your life app. It also focuses on skills and character building, which is my favorite part and mostly missing with comparable apps. Takes a bit to get into it, but it's definitely worth it :D",positive
7727,"This app is amazing! You can customise your tasks and give yourself rewards in a shop. It really boosted my productivity and helped me get through the tasks that were a bit harder. Highly recommend this app, especially at this time!",positive
7728,"Easily the best task manager app out there, while the rpg aspect is a HUGE plus. The user is able to fully customize pretty much every little bit of the app to make it better suit their habits, or soon-to-be habits!",positive
7729,"Very awesome so far! I really love how customizable this is. It does so much it takes a while to learn how to utilize all the features, but I am super happy 👍. Hope it continues to be great with continued use.",positive
7730,"Good concept. Would go for premium if price adjusted to be a bit more reasonable (to give context, other productivity apps created with a similar aim are around the $2-10 mark.)",positive
7731,"Fun, free, and heavily customizable. If you are a gamer, even in the casual sense, this is the app for you. 

*Edit* (2.1.2020) : One problem to note is that there doesn't seem to be an easy way to renew overdue tasks. By which I mean in other apps I can usually refresh them all with one click so that the tasks are due today. Would love an option for that, since otherwise I have to go into each task and set it to be due today. TT^TT",positive
7732,"Very pleasant to work with, although it would be nice to have sub-skills that are part of a more general skill, for example a specific language that is part of languages in general, and the option to rank up high level skils, for example begginer(insert topic here) at level 100 evolves to adept(insert topic here) and goes down to level 1.",positive
7733,"first of all, I am thrilled with the app. If I know how it works. Is there a list of ready-made tasks? On the start screen there are some suggested ones. When I press the plus button, I actually expect a list with all possible tasks. But instead of that I only have the possibility to create a new task. At first I thought that I had to subscribe. I have subscribed now but unfortunately it is still not possible. Now I have deleted all tasks from the start screen. If I click on the plus, there is still no list. It comes again: new task",positive
7734,"This is an awesome app! I initially thought the idea of ""gamifying"" my life was a little silly, but fun. After trying for two weeks it is far more motivating than I ever thought! 😁 Thank you, this is finally getting me into habits I have been trying to develop. I one thing I have difficulty with is the subtasks; once I complete the subtasks they don't carry over to the next day's parent task. However, the rest of the features of this app are so great you still get 5-stars!",positive
7735,"This App is Excellent! My Therapist suggested I started planning my days in advance to get a better handle on my sporadic attention management skills. (I have ADHD 🤓) I have been using it since Friday and am very pleased. I am a huge fan of RPGs and this has helped me keep focused and on task. It's like I'm leveling up to go Adulting! ⚔ If I am still using it by the end of the month effectively, I'm buying the developers some coffee and getting the subscription! Great job dudes!",positive
7736,"I loved the idea and downloaded to try it. This app is helping me a lot, thank you. BTW, I suggest you to do an IOS version, I have friends who want to use it too. Edit : I'm sure it'll be a huge success there too!",positive
7737,This app is actually really handy. It really keeps me motivated. I would highly reccomend this app to anyone that has trouble staying organized.,positive
7738,I've tried several of these kind of things and this seems the most versatile. It takes a while to get the hang of it and I'm still discovering aspects of the app that I didn't know where there. Most times I think something about the app is not good I am realising that I just didn't uncover the setting that fixes the issue yet!,positive
7739,"One week of use & I purchased a subscription. I've used other similar apps, I enjoy this the most. There a few improvements needed, so I need to add suggestions to the Reddit page. I spent time & wrote out what I value in life, what my aspirations are, & then I narrowed down a few simple goals to reach those aspirations. Then I added my goals to this app. So far it's easy to keep track of my goals, habits, & how I'm doing. It's incredibly easy & even fun to use. Thank you for this app.",positive
7740,"SO USEFUL!! I struggle with ADHD on a daily basis, I can never remember to do simple tasks and things like notebooks, whiteboards, stickynotes, alarms, they just Don't Work. But this app helps change the game dude!! It's a clever way to incentivize completing tasks, and it's helping me build better habits with the reminders and penalties for not completing it if you miss it. SUPER USEFUL!! I feel more productive and motivated to get my tasks done, I'm grateful this app exists",positive
7741,"Fun way to Track your chores and get small challenges to get better. Nice idea, good app thumbs up!",positive
7742,"Very cool app. Using it for real life stuff as if it's a video game is so fun. Could have some bug tweaks and possibly an overhaul for the interface, but it's still close to perfect and runs great.",positive
7743,"I sent email to the developer (there's only one!) and they solved everything within minutes. Great app, helps with tasks and even small silly works. It is improving quickly and is getting better every time",positive
7744,"On the one hand... It takes a while to customize and set up, but that's because there are a lot of options for customization available, which I love. This is helpful motivating me to accomplish my tasks.",positive
7745,"This app is a great help for me! This helps me enjoy productivity in whole new level. I have been struggling for years to get my life back together, but with this app I feel like I can finally get some work done in a fun and enjoyable way. Thank you very much!",positive
7746,marvellous! makes a game out of everyday life. helps you organise your tasks while feeding stats about the progress YOU consider important! and the gold-xp reward & punishment system gives some type of extra motive. brilliant i say,positive
7747,I just wish it wasnt a subsciption and i could just buy it once otherwise its professional app and i love how it lets you customize rewards. Always wondered what my life as an rpg game would be like and Do It Now lets that happen.,positive
7748,This one person has give me the most used app I have. Super customizable to fit most needs. It has helped me stay focused on my goal more than any other. I recommend this app to everyone I know.,positive
7749,So far this app does everything I need it to do! It helps me to keep track of all of the tasks I want to accomplish and helps me make positive steps towards changing bad habits.,positive
7750,A more in depth kind of to-do list. Plus you get to monitor where the kind of activities you do would lead you in the long run. Good job.,positive
7751,Imporant functions can be used only if you subscribe. It would be best if they rather sell this app than make people pay for subscption. It's worth their money anyway.,positive
7752,"Very versatile and customizable! Still new to it, but it looks very promising, if not polished yet.",positive
7753,It's very good. It helps me more about my difficulties in habits tracking. I found it best of all,positive
7754,"So far, this app has had a profound impact on me getting things done. It does rely a bit on the honor system, but if you're down for it, it can be very good.",positive
7755,So addicting especially for gamers who love to level up!!!,positive
7756,Brilliant and incredible app. It turns my daily life into enjoyable one with simple RPG concept. Love it!!!,positive
7757,"Very nice app, it helped me feel more motivated. I can now see life more as a game and as something that's supposed to be fun.",positive
7758,Excellent and detailed beyond average love it!!!,positive
7759,"I love gamification at work. Creating a simple, customizable system for home life is great!",positive
7760,Just getting started with this app but so far I love it! Great way to track good habits and bad!,positive

7762,Great app to track your daily tasks. It is very customizable!,positive
7763,"This app has been more entertaining than I even expected. I have been looking for a productivity app that I will stick with, and this is the one!",positive
7764,"I Love the concept, I've always saw the parallel between RealLife and an RRG in terms of skill growth and education.",positive
7765,"Absolutely Love this app, paid and unpaid versions worth the time!",positive
7766,Very flexible for now.. . Waiting for the long term results,positive
7767,"I don't have this app for long, but it is really easy to use so i like it, it also allows you to skip a day if you can't do it that day (just change the day)",positive
7768,An amazing app with a creative concept. One of the best task managing apps out there,positive
7769,"Really Nice App Sir could you please provide goal tracking functionality too, that'd be very useful too : )",positive
7770,"You can list what you need to do, and set up weekly, monthly and daily tasks.",positive
7771,Very nice app and I think it will help you with your routine.,positive
7772,"I can see this app sereously help, me and family members build good habits. I'm excited to give this a shot.",positive
7773,Great good tracking with work and lifestyle,positive
7774,Great app! Kept me organised and disciplined. Thank you 👍,positive
7775,Very flexible and the customization is huge.,positive
7776,"Best app ever, addictive to complete task and see progression!!!",positive
7777,Was inspired by the Novel Solo Leveling and it works!,positive
7778,Adds not to frequent. Good time tracker,positive
7779,Personally I absolutely love this app and it is exactly mathematically what I have been looking for. The only true inconvenience is that once the day is over you cannot go back and add tasks to a day. Developers could you pretty pretty pretty please with sugar on top make it possible for us to go back and add tasks that we have completed on previous days!?! Maybe in the calendar area or something! Thank you kindly! 🙏❣️ Revision: 5 star! Thank you for responding and teaching me hot to edit task!,positive
7780,Very good no ads are seen using from 3 days,positive

7782,"This is actually fun, I get excited everytime I complete a task.",positive
7783,Very nice app. It helps me be more productive ☺,positive
7784,"I love this app. I use it for motivation with my writing. I custimized the skills, characteristics, achievements, and my hero levels to reflect my writerly ways and it's been so fun to use! Watching my skills and levels increase is a blast. I also appreciate the"" rewards""options, but wish I could create""in-app"" rewards for myself. Like potions or consumables that could increase a skill or boost XP earning for one day, etc. Even without that, though, this app is amazing! I highly recommend it.",positive
7785,"This honestly makes tracking my daily life and staying responsible so much more fun. Having rewards is a great way to remind people that it's important to reward yourself for your hard work! I'm a really competitive person so this is really handy for actually getting myself to do things. Even if the reward is small, it's still gratifying to level up for not skipping uni or using the treadmill! Super rad and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a more fun life tracking app :B",positive
7786,Easy to use and customize,positive
7787,Absolutely awesome. I've only had it for a few days but it's behaved like a dream. Much more detailed/customizable than any other 'gamify' app I have used.,positive
7788,"So far I love it. You can turn your life into a game and reward yourself for everyday tasks. No life coach can do a better job. You earn gold and XP for daily chores. Awesome, and so far no issues.",positive
7789,This is app is absolutely awesome! I had to spend a little time customizing all the various skills and characteristics but once it's set up it's absolutely fantastic!,positive
7790,"Amazing, Love this app. Not only good but also fun, maybe at the first is difficult to set a lot of thing but after that is amazing.",positive
7791,"Started 2 days ago, learned to add new tasks, it's a good little way to push your will.",positive
7792,"Although limited, still useful",positive
7793,"The xp system and character sheet are a good way to motivate you to finish tasks, although yes, you can cheat and give infinite xp but you're only cheating yourself.",positive
7794,This app turned everything into a game. It really helped me to focus on tasks and be more organized & productive.,positive
7795,I love this app! I use it to gamify truly boring things; like uploading my business receipts and putting dishes in the actual dishwasher vs. the entire house.,positive
7796,So much fun to use and makes me feel better about doing everything I need to,positive
7797,"Great. Smart looking App... It has help me improve my hardwork. Sometimes in a day, you wish someone could remind you of what to do but guess, you might have no one... It has been helpful to me. Thanks a lot guy...",positive
7798,I love it. But needs more ready tasks and a rank to make more competitive and share tasks.,positive
7799,"Best app... Truely, No apps in playsore like this.. The app will progress in future... Add more things on this app and update as soon as possible.. Tnx...",positive
7800,"Amazing app, it's helping me so much developing my discipline and have my to do list always on point, thanks ever so much guys!",positive
7801,"I like it . But I want little more in this aap , like with point make hero upgrade, more facility....",positive
7802,Great app I would like to have the option for purchasing a permanent full version. I wouldn't mind paying 20 USD,positive

7807,Highly motivating and helps to organize and track progress.,positive
7808,Thoroughly enjoy it and not too intrusive that it becomes a chore in itself,positive
7809,I'm liking it so far! :) It's actually motivating me a bit! Will update review with time.,positive
7810,"Play RPG in real life, that is a great concept, I love it.",positive

7819,"Wonderful app, must have took a lot of effort to make it",positive
7820,A great idea and an entertaining design.,positive
7821,"The recent updates were very amazing. Keep it coming devs. This is close to perfection. However, I hope we can gain items attached to a particular task. Once the task is completed, the items will be given directly to your inventory. This can help us to create weekly task events or bosses. It will be very rewarding. Thank you! Update: One last thing, in terms of habit generation, can we have counting streak instead of count down... The higher the streak, the higher the rewards 🙃",positive
7822,Really good. I usually forget my duties and this app really notificate me and make me do them with some xp hahahaha,positive
7823,"I love dnd so I love this app, too.",positive
7824,Nice,positive
7825,"Good concept. Would go for premium if price adjusted to be a bit more reasonable (to give context, other productivity apps created with a similar aim are around the $2-10 mark.)",positive
7826,"The best app for habit-tracking I ever tried. Though possibility of sorting by colour, hiding tasks for predefined time and direct influence of task completion on characteristics without skills mediation would make it perfect indeed. Free trial would be fine too. And please, unite 2+ done tasks of same type into one row.",positive
7827,Very motivational.,positive
7828,"I love gamification at work. Creating a simple, customizable system for home life is great!",positive
7829,Adds not to frequent. Good time tracker,positive

7839,"I've tried several RPG To-Do lists, but this one is the best out of them all. It contains all of the features you need to motivate yourself to get off your butt and do something in your life, especially during this period of quarantine. Read the user guide in settings after installing to understand how it works, and get to it! A big Thanks to developer for their quick responses.",positive
7840,This app is actually really handy. It really keeps me motivated. I would highly reccomend this app to anyone that has trouble staying organized.,positive
7841,"I LOVE this app. I've always had a hard time with planners because I just couldn't see the point, but that allows me to plan and have fun. I feel like I'm constantly playing a video game, but the main character is me! It has definitely improved my life! Thanks a ton, developers!",positive
7842,Good make me full organized life,positive
7843,"Great app if you keep it to a short list of achievable habits, fun to use, good statistics for tracking progress, you can input things retroactively if you forget at the time, has dark theme, customization options when it comes to tasks, skills, and characteristics. Lightweight, easy to use. Overall I don't think I have any complaints, it delivers what if says it does well, no more, no less. Tldr: love it.",positive
7844,"This is by far the most useful and customisable Gamify your life app. It also focuses on skills and character building, which is my favorite part and mostly missing with comparable apps. Takes a bit to get into it, but it's definitely worth it :D",positive
7845,Works great!,positive
7846,Increase very good,positive
7847,Excellent and detailed beyond average love it!!!,positive
7848,"Здравствуйте, ваше приложение мне очень помагает в работе и рутине. Очень обширная программа с множеством функций. У меня предложение ! Как вам идея добавлять собственные иконки к задачам, как например к аватарке героя. Мне кажется, что среди всех иконок может и не быть нужной. Иконки же дадут возможность максимального представления о задаче. К примеру я занимаюсь пайкой и покупаю различные модели паяльников, радиодеталей. Хотелось бы добавить изображение конкретного елемента. Будет круто!",positive
7849,"Fun way to Track your chores and get small challenges to get better. Nice idea, good app thumbs up!",positive

7857,"I loved the idea and downloaded to try it. This app is helping me a lot, thank you. BTW, I suggest you to do an IOS version, I have friends who want to use it too. Edit : I'm sure it'll be a huge success there too!",positive
7858,"I am a vanilla habitician, but that game failed to serve it's purpose several times and I eventually quit. I linked it to several systemic errors. I was even thinking about creating my own habit rpg free of those but then I found Do It Now. Not only it answers all of my concerns it even adds more features, like drawbacks for completing certain tasks (anti-procrastinator) or putting player in position where he has to maintain his characteristics. Amazing, thank you devs. Please port it to web.",positive

7871,"This is an awesome app! I initially thought the idea of ""gamifying"" my life was a little silly, but fun. After trying for two weeks it is far more motivating than I ever thought! 😁 Thank you, this is finally getting me into habits I have been trying to develop. I one thing I have difficulty with is the subtasks; once I complete the subtasks they don't carry over to the next day's parent task. However, the rest of the features of this app are so great you still get 5-stars!",positive

7883,"One week of use & I purchased a subscription. I've used other similar apps, I enjoy this the most. There a few improvements needed, so I need to add suggestions to the Reddit page. I spent time & wrote out what I value in life, what my aspirations are, & then I narrowed down a few simple goals to reach those aspirations. Then I added my goals to this app. So far it's easy to keep track of my goals, habits, & how I'm doing. It's incredibly easy & even fun to use. Thank you for this app.",positive

7889,"SO USEFUL!! I struggle with ADHD on a daily basis, I can never remember to do simple tasks and things like notebooks, whiteboards, stickynotes, alarms, they just Don't Work. But this app helps change the game dude!! It's a clever way to incentivize completing tasks, and it's helping me build better habits with the reminders and penalties for not completing it if you miss it. SUPER USEFUL!! I feel more productive and motivated to get my tasks done, I'm grateful this app exists",positive

7907,Awesome app very good at keeping me accountable.,positive
7908,"first of all, I am thrilled with the app. If I know how it works. Is there a list of ready-made tasks? On the start screen there are some suggested ones. When I press the plus button, I actually expect a list with all possible tasks. But instead of that I only have the possibility to create a new task. At first I thought that I had to subscribe. I have subscribed now but unfortunately it is still not possible. Now I have deleted all tasks from the start screen. If I click on the plus, there is still no list. It comes again: new task",positive
7909,marvellous! makes a game out of everyday life. helps you organise your tasks while feeding stats about the progress YOU consider important! and the gold-xp reward & punishment system gives some type of extra motive. brilliant i say,positive
7910,Cool app!,positive
7911,"It's easy to use and from all of the habit apps I installed, I still came back to this and realize this is my ideal habit app. Truly love it❤❤",positive
7912,A more in depth kind of to-do list. Plus you get to monitor where the kind of activities you do would lead you in the long run. Good job.,positive
7913,Awesome. Muito bom,positive
7914,Makes doing chores seem more achievable and really helps me see my progress in being a better human.,positive
7915,"So far, this app has had a profound impact on me getting things done. It does rely a bit on the honor system, but if you're down for it, it can be very good.",positive
7916,It's very good. It helps me more about my difficulties in habits tracking. I found it best of all,positive
7917,Fun,positive

7972,Just started using the app. App is user friendly but I put my phone in vibration mode and notification alarms never worked. All the times I set passed without any notification. I am surprised because I had taken HabitNow off the battery optimisation list on my phone and I expected alarms to work without any hitches.,neutral
7973,"I like this app and I bought Premium, even it was a little expensive (5,49 Euro). What I don't like is: Habits ""with a numeric value"" don't allow ""at least 0 times a day"". If you want to do something 6 times a week, with the possibility to do it twice on one day, it will stay undone the other days (-1 *). Tasks/Habits which are marked as undone may be send to the bottom, too (-1 *). Whitout Premium you only can scedule up to 7 habits! After a removal of any named defect I will change my rating.",neutral
7974,"Firstly, thanks for your quick responses back. I appreciate it. Ok, so can you explain how to do it and where that is on the app? Because there's no tutorial for that part. When I click on the other tabs that show the month stats and graph there's nothing indicating that the old schedule has been saved in an independent track and a new track created.",neutral
7975,It has almost everything that I need but the thing that frustrates me the most is the calendar view. That's really the most important thing to see how many days you've tracked in a row. Switch to calendar view it looks just like a regular calendar and nothing is highlighted for anything. You have to click on each individual day to see what it looks like.,neutral
7976,I like this app. It's simple and gets the job done. Only downside is you're allowed to track up to only seven habits without the premium version.,neutral
7977,"Setting habits was not simple enough and at the same time was missing options. It kept telling me to choose a number, I would, press next, and same error.",neutral
7978,I can't arrange my habits in the order I want. I have to choose from preselected options like alphabetical.,neutral
7979,I don't get any notification on the tasks to be done neither do alarm work and so I am get frustrated pls do help me with this apart from that it is a good habit tracking app,neutral
7980,You can have just 5 habits for free. We should have more,neutral
7981,I did like the app..after I'm reinstalling the app..what happens to my In app purchase..I had purchased the app..Rt now which I'm using is it the paid one or free one. Do I need to pay for premium again??,neutral
7982,"My personal experience with the app makes me say this is deforme designed more as a task management app than a habit tracking app. The two things I want to do when building a new habit are 1) easily enter the stats for the habits I'm tracking and 2) see the timeline of the habit growth in a snapshot or as a dashboard. This app focuses on ""today's tasks"", so getting to the specific habits, entering information for another day and charting progress are too cumbersome.",neutral
7983,"This app works nice if you want to track daily or weekly tasks, but it was impossible for me to schedule tasks that should happen at a certain interval. For example, every two weeks, or every 5th of the month. There is the option to schedule a task a certain amount of times per month, but not to set specific intervals or dates for such occurrences. This was unfortunately a dealbreaker.",neutral
7984,"Nice but it's really irritating that you can't edit frequency! Or a start date but I could live with that. Unfortunately, when your schedule / circumstances change, you have to create a new habit because you can't change days and frequency! EDIT: Thanks guys for the prompt response! Fingers crossed the update with this feature is released soon! 🤞",neutral
7985,"It's very useful so far, however I'm not sure if you can change your daily routine. I made one for Monday and it auto filled for every single day of the week, whereas I need them different and when I go to try and add a new task to my day that I want, it changes it for all of them. Disappointing and useless if theres no way to bypass that...might as well go back to pen and paper.",neutral
7986,"Seems like it could have been great for me. However, lack of ability to modify repeating schedule (e.g. which days of the week) is a blocker. Switched to HabitHub for now.",neutral
7987,Unfortunately the free version does not provide enough functionality for me. I am trying to track habits but it stopped me at 7.,neutral

8069,Its a good app! I honestly dont mind that you need to have premium to get the themes. As long as there are no ads im fine! I just wish you could create a widget that you can see on your home screen. That would be so convenient!,positive

Everything else you can edit,..time, date, category, but wanted to change my days and I had to delete the entry and start over to modify my scheduled days. Otherwise, I would've rated it 5☆s",positive
8072,"It's relatively helpful especially when checking habit progress. However, some notifications do not come on time but nevertheless, i recommend it.",positive
8073,this is actually a really good app. I just have a couple of suggestions that make things a little more helpful 1. to be able to rearrange the habits or tasks by the time we have it set so it will look like more of a daily schedule instead of just a list 2. a button that goes with when you want to do your habit or task have it be more specific just in case we want to break our task or habit up and do half earlier in the day and the other half like drinking water or studying.,positive
8074,Another important feature missing is the ability to tell if I have future tasks scheduled when looking at the calendar. Currently the calander view shows days in a circle. Please colorize the background of that circle if there are tasks scheduled on that day. This is essential in order to know what days i have future tasks scheduled on. On top of the calendar it says to pick a day to see if i have a scheduled task. That is not efficient as i would need to go click each day one by one.,positive
8075,"Very nice UI, but need some work. 1) First week day (Monday/Sunday) option in Calendar; 2) Calendar should show tasks/habits below Calendar instead of when touching the selected day only (this makes you feel you have nothing the whole day/mont)... Add this and app will be more solid... And I may jump into Premium! Keep it up!",positive
8076,"Love it, bought premium. BUT needs an option to schedule reoccurring tasks like ""take mom shopping first Sunday of every month at 11am.""",positive
8077,"Thank you for responding and I'm looking forward to that update (customized categories). Another improvement I'd love to see are more options for a goal besides a daily one, such as save $100 per week, etc. I got the Premium and love the dark theme, this app is the best I've found for my needs. Thank you!",positive
8078,Simple and practical,positive
8079,This app is really functional and helpful. The widget is great. Caveat: you can only track seven habits without paying. It's one time five bucks and worth it though. Suggestion to the developer: make checked off habits go to the bottom of the list so we can see what we haven't done yet more easily.,positive
8080,So close to being the perfect app. 2 things needed before I switch to using it. #1. Add ability to edit and change habit status for previous days. sometimes i don't have time or forget to update my habits on the day of. #2. Ability to set first day of week for calendar (i prefer Monday),positive
8081,"Only used for a day but it's the best app I've found for daily tasks / to do lists. Would love to see the following: 1. Completed tasks move to the bottom 2. Tasks be linked to a numerical value. 3. The ability to order each item manually, daily.",positive
8082,I subscribed for premium because I feel it's nice. Could you tell me where to check the status report? And how to re-organize the habits freely without any sorting order? Thanks Edit: Please add option for statistics tab separately and need to work on showing them correctly on average.,positive
8083,I really like this app so far. Its flexible ans very customizable. The only thing I would add is either more categories/the ability to add my own. Health and Home are very broad categories. So being able to have sub categories would be nice,positive
8084,"Just installed this app, it is easy to use and is quite beautiful. I would love to have a vision board feature page that I can put pics and maybe a daily quote feature (spiritual?) before jumping to Premium, please.",positive
8085,Very useful! Reminders at specific times which stay on the screen really help me get stuff done. Would like to be able to create own catagories and choose colours and icons for these in the premium version Thank you!,positive
8086,great app. could be better if I could have the same habit with multiple notification times so i can do it several times a day without having to recreate the habit several times. thanks,positive
8087,"Very nice, but would you consider letting people create custom categories, and setting intervals such as ""every 2 days"" instead of number of times a week? With that, this app would be perfect.",positive
8088,I liked it I just have to many things I want to put in it and I can't afford to pay for premium.,positive

Second, edit start dates without having to delete and retype to correct. Three, have the ability to add notes.",positive
8132,"So far I like the app. Question - I see a spot where it says, notes for the month, but how do I input notes? I don't see the option to enter notes.",positive
8133,"Hey, awesome app. It wasn't long until I purchased the unlocked version. However, some things could be improved. For example, you can't change units after the habit is created. And it would be nice to hide the "".0"" part after digits, since mostly it refers to ""minutes"" or ""iterations"" or ""cups"" and it looks kinda sloppy to see your goal described as ""Learn at least 30.0 minutes"" or ""Drink at least 2.0 cups"". If the number is whole, why not just hide that point zero - it'll look neater, I think.",positive
8134,Great app! How can I change the alarm sound,positive
8135,awesome app .. i like the daily work and habit tracking .. thanks guys,positive
8136,Helped me a lot,positive
8137,"Make sure your phone settings are allowing the app to make notifications.The app works great, and is super helpful. The only thing I would recommend is to be able to make custom categories. Right now you can do other, but can't specify. Would definitely recommend app. Update 2- I can't seem to find the setting that lets me see the notifications. I can get it to work but only once then it stops. Would you be able to help me out? After my first review you said you'd be able to if I needed it.",positive
8138,I liked it I just have to many things I want to put in it and I can't afford to pay for premium.,positive
8139,I like it. It's quite easy to use. Would it be possible to sync data between devices? That would be a lovely plus!,positive
8140,"Best productivity app I've found, goal progress tracking, hierarchical task management and progress reports would make it even better",positive
8141,"Just installed and trying out (I'll update along with my experiences). UI/UX is pleasant and clear. Looks promising. Love the Free full-featured & Premium accessory-features philosophy; I'll pay later on to support development. ISSUES: 1) can't change start-date & repetition of a habit; if it'll break history data, at least allow duplication 2) would expect SCHEDULED days to be colored/marked in the single habit calendar, as future overview; not just as achievement overview. ## So far, good job!",positive
8142,I liked it but once I got it I saw a had no need for it and I felt like I don't need it as much as others.,positive
8143,Simple and practical,positive
8144,"This is a great app! The ability to track my habits and edit them as needed is really awesome. There are just 2 things I'd really like to see that would make this a 5-star review for me: 1) Full editing options (currently can't edit the frequency for my times per period items), and 2) A help/glossary feature. I'm not sure exactly what the link icon means, as it is 0 on items I've not done or done once, but 1 on items that I've done twice or three times.",positive
8145,Easy to add habits and tasks; you see everything for that dat,positive
8146,it s great,positive
8147,"Very versatile, keeps you on the track and highlights your strengths and weaknesses So impressed that I bought premium on very first day to have unlimited habits 4 stars only because there is no possibility to set monthly repeated task neither on a specific date (e.g. 3th of every month) nor on specific day (e.g. second Wednesday in a month) Otherwise it would be 5*",positive
8148,"I like this app but I dont understand why I cant set up tasks that repeat unless they're habits. Or edit the categories. A habit is something you want to always do, I want to plan reoccurring tasks that are temporary.",positive
8149,"Would have been a five star had something as simple as a color theme change not came with a price. Seriously?! I have to pay premium prices just to go into dark mode. If I was going to pay, I'm most certainly not paying now. That's just too petty a thing. However, great concept guys.",positive
8150,"Great, simple app. Notifications can be better; they pop out irrespective of whether goal was achieved and thus are useless.",positive
8151,"Great app, keeps me on track and efficient. Helps me stick to my New Year's goals. Just wish we could add more habits.",positive
8152,"All to do lists should embrace habit monitoring. Also, I like it when a pending task persists on the list until it's done or removed.",positive
8153,Set a color which depends on percentage for goals.,positive
8154,Very good.,positive
8155,"Very nice looking app for tracking habits and tasks. Have already replaced my old task app for HabitNow. Glad you can purchase the premium version and not have to buy a subscription like many other apps are now doing. I've been unable to figure out how to make tasks repeat and modify the schedule of existing habits. If these capabilities don't exist, would love to see these as improvements.",positive
8156,good enough👍👍👍,positive
8157,"Love it, bought premium. BUT needs an option to schedule reoccurring tasks like ""take mom shopping first Sunday of every month at 11am.""",positive
8158,Good app with notifications for reminding you and helping you track your progress,positive
8159,"Your app is awesome, please add sticky notification",positive
8160,Good,positive
8161,"I love this app, it's the only one I've found which combines tasks and habits in a simple way. However, I do get frustrated that I can't seem to change the scheduling of a habit after I've set it up. E.g. If it's set for once a week and I want to make it twice I have to delete it and create a new one. Can you please fix this",positive
8162,Its a good app! I honestly dont mind that you need to have premium to get the themes. As long as there are no ads im fine! I just wish you could create a widget that you can see on your home screen. That would be so convenient!,positive
8163,Please add an option to update habit/task status from the notification bar when I receive notification on the set time. Overall good app.,positive
8164,"It's relatively helpful especially when checking habit progress. However, some notifications do not come on time but nevertheless, i recommend it.",positive
8165,"Great updates! Nice color, nice experience, pro version is better, wished more was free. Need quick add tasks (see Tick Tick), needs folders, and a pomo timer would be awesome.Thanks for adding sort and categories!",positive
8166,It is a good for organising daily task n making habit,positive
8167,"I like this app alot. It lets me track my habits and goals in an intuitive way. Only would ask a few minor things, like a line on the bar chart that shows the limit/goal & task alarms even when app not active.",positive
8168,"Very nice, but would you consider letting people create custom categories, and setting intervals such as ""every 2 days"" instead of number of times a week? With that, this app would be perfect.",positive
8169,Another important feature missing is the ability to tell if I have future tasks scheduled when looking at the calendar. Currently the calander view shows days in a circle. Please colorize the background of that circle if there are tasks scheduled on that day. This is essential in order to know what days i have future tasks scheduled on. On top of the calendar it says to pick a day to see if i have a scheduled task. That is not efficient as i would need to go click each day one by one.,positive
8170,Handy habit helper,positive
8171,"Just installed this app, it is easy to use and is quite beautiful. I would love to have a vision board feature page that I can put pics and maybe a daily quote feature (spiritual?) before jumping to Premium, please.",positive
8172,Good app. Wish there were more customization,positive
8173,"Very nice UI, but need some work. 1) First week day (Monday/Sunday) option in Calendar; 2) Calendar should show tasks/habits below Calendar instead of when touching the selected day only (this makes you feel you have nothing the whole day/mont)... Add this and app will be more solid... And I may jump into Premium! Keep it up!",positive
8174,I subscribed for premium because I feel it's nice. Could you tell me where to check the status report? And how to re-organize the habits freely without any sorting order? Thanks Edit: Please add option for statistics tab separately and need to work on showing them correctly on average.,positive
8175,"Only used for a day but it's the best app I've found for daily tasks / to do lists. Would love to see the following: 1. Completed tasks move to the bottom 2. Tasks be linked to a numerical value. 3. The ability to order each item manually, daily.",positive
8176,"Love it, it works! I would like to have had it transfer my habits to the new phone but the backup folder didn't work. So I had to do them all over again. overall love it though.",positive
8177,"Thank you for responding and I'm looking forward to that update (customized categories). Another improvement I'd love to see are more options for a goal besides a daily one, such as save $100 per week, etc. I got the Premium and love the dark theme, this app is the best I've found for my needs. Thank you!",positive
8178,great app. could be better if I could have the same habit with multiple notification times so i can do it several times a day without having to recreate the habit several times. thanks,positive
8179,Very useful! Reminders at specific times which stay on the screen really help me get stuff done. Would like to be able to create own catagories and choose colours and icons for these in the premium version Thank you!,positive
8180,This app is really functional and helpful. The widget is great. Caveat: you can only track seven habits without paying. It's one time five bucks and worth it though. Suggestion to the developer: make checked off habits go to the bottom of the list so we can see what we haven't done yet more easily.,positive
8181,this is actually a really good app. I just have a couple of suggestions that make things a little more helpful 1. to be able to rearrange the habits or tasks by the time we have it set so it will look like more of a daily schedule instead of just a list 2. a button that goes with when you want to do your habit or task have it be more specific just in case we want to break our task or habit up and do half earlier in the day and the other half like drinking water or studying.,positive
8182,So close to being the perfect app. 2 things needed before I switch to using it. #1. Add ability to edit and change habit status for previous days. sometimes i don't have time or forget to update my habits on the day of. #2. Ability to set first day of week for calendar (i prefer Monday),positive
8183,quite a good app for me,positive
8184,"Really like this app, the layout, and ease of use. However, I did not see a way to go back and edit your scheduled days. Everything else you can edit,..time, date, category, but wanted to change my days and I had to delete the entry and start over to modify my scheduled days. Otherwise, I would've rated it 5☆s",positive
8185,I really like this app so far. Its flexible ans very customizable. The only thing I would add is either more categories/the ability to add my own. Health and Home are very broad categories. So being able to have sub categories would be nice,positive
8186,"Honestly great. Simple. Effective. 1 time purchase. The UI has a sort of dated look but it's very quick and easy to use. Most of my daily habits vary alot based on which day it is, my schedule varies so much I cant put them on a specifik time, and I almost always do them in the same order. Therefore there should be an option to change the order of the habits manually, yourself, without any variables. :)",positive
8187,"I love how simple this app is. I've tried full GTD systems, which are too complicated for me. By keeping things simple, this app forces you to prioritize. I don't need hundreds of tasks organized in a hierarchy, just a simple app to keep my goals in sight. This app does it with a beautiful easy-to-read interface. Tip: You have to be creative with the sorting order to make it work for you. For example, I sort my today list by: 1. Priority; 2. Habits first. 3. Time. It works beautifully for me.",positive
8188,"Love it! A scheduling app that doesn't force me to sync my google calendar with it! I downloaded 5 different apps that all did and it was so incredibly frustrating, I deleted them all right away and finally found what I was looking for! I use my google calendar to keep track of bills and things like that, and those calendars have national holidays and other stuff I just don't want mixed in with my day to day sched. I wanted a blank calendar app to schedule things. It was surprsingly hard to find",positive
8189,"The best app in the market for improving your daily habits. I researched many Habit apps in Play store and finally concluded that this is the best one. I changed my self a lot by regulary monitoring my habits through HabitNow App. The user interface is superb and quite simple. Also it provides habit statistics up to date. You can also enter your habits according to the category like Health, nutrition etc..A must have App for everybody!!",positive
8190,"Excellent if you use it properly. The only thing I would change is the notification and alarms settings. I want notifications to come through even when I'm not actively looking at the app. Right now, I'm not notified until I open the app and the pop-ups show up.",positive
8191,"This app is wonderful! I love that it has an option for numerical input each day. It is also great that there are both individual tasks and continuous habits, as previously I have had to use two separate apps for this. I did pay for the premium version, but I like that the app still functions effectively even if you have the free version. I would love to have a visual of my progress in each habit for the past week, but that is the only recommendation I can make. Overall this app is perfect!",positive
8192,"So far so good. Just started using this app about a week ago. It's working well and is pretty clear cut as to adding or editing the habits. I like the option for reminders. If it continues to work well in the next few weeks, am thinking of buying premium at discounted "" launch"" price of $4.99 . That describes widgets as an extra and I am just wondering what that means.",positive
8193,"The best app of its kind, hands down. The only thing I would improve is the reminder system: right now the app would send you a notification to complete a habit/task even after you've already done it, when in my opinion it should automatically turn off. It's a minor thing, but it tends to get a bit silly when you've completed a lot of tasks ahead of schedule. Other than that, it's perfect.",positive
8194,"I got this app to track my medication and it's perfect! I can set up how I want to take each medicine (yes/no or quantity), see the start date and adherence in the summary view, and even track side effects and effectiveness each day then see them in a chronological list in the sunmary. And the best part is that it's not tied to some medical database! Added bonus: I can track real to-dos as well. Overall, love this app!",positive
8195,"I'm trying to develop some healthy habits, and this app is very good at reminding me to do things. The only complaint I have is that you can't actually organize your tasks and habits. I try to organize them by time and they don't move. I have a habit for 12pm listed after one for 3am, which is preceded by 4pm. This is very frustrating when you want to look at things in order. That's why I'm docking 1⭐. I like the function of it and I like the widget. Update: 1⭐ restored- thank you for helping!",positive
8196,Exactly what I was looking for to help establish routines. I like that I can set it to place habits on certain days and don't manually have to readd them. My only suggestion is to be able to manually sort items,positive
8197,This app has worked great with no glitches. It does exactly what I need it to do and has had a valuable impact on my life. One minor update I'd like to see is a way to customise the category titles. Sometimes the preset ones don't match up with the tasks I do.,positive
8198,I love this app so much it has really helped me get into a morning and night time routine. Before I found this app I was always late for school and felt really unhealthy in myself. But now I'm I'm always early for school and make sure I wake up every morning at the right time thank you to this app so much,positive
8199,"Just what I've been searching for. I like the compact view of the routines and tasks, and the satisfying way to mark them completed or not. The sorting options are useful. It would be great if you could add automatic syncing to gdrive at some point.",positive
8200,Great habit tracking app. Very clean and simple interface. Fantastically elegant design. Other habit tracking apps are not as user friendly. I contacted the developers on a couple of concerns I had and they were already working on these features to be added in future updates.,positive
8201,I've been using this app for a week and so far it is great! It has really helped me hold myself accountable for habits that I want to break or start. Way better than I thought. I never end up liking self help apps. I also never write reviews. Give the one a chance.,positive
8202,"Great little app. Lovely interface, and does what I need it do by reminding me what tasks/habits I want to do each day. I like the feature where I can see my overall success percentage for each habit.",positive
8203,"tried all habit tracker apps, it's the best one yet. just please add an option to the calendar icon so i can see all the habits & tasks together at the calendar & read their notes or success / failure rate. keep up the good work.",positive
8204,The app is great. But I cannot purchase premium version. It says that cannot connect to Internet and my Internet is working... so I cannot use all advantages of this app unfortunately...,positive
8205,Great app works very well it helps alot especially at this time with this pandemic helps to keep everything that you need to keep track of what and where you should be and to keep track of your symptoms and must know information. Check this app out.,positive
8206,"This is the best and simplest habit app that I have used. I had tried a couple of others and never stuck with them. I use the notification feature to send me a reminder to mark off my habits for the day, so I don't even have to think about remembering to update it.",positive
8207,"Really versatile app, got the premium version almost immediately. Very easy to use, love dark theme, not invasive and doesn't cause anxiety with pending habits/tasks. I'd like to see a feature added to make daily notes for each habit and one to let you chose the icon for 'other' category habits.",positive
8208,"I can't say enough good things about the app and the dev and support teams. Super stable, lots of great features, and the most responsive support team I've worked with personally or professionally. Invest in this app! You'll love it and you'll support a company that is doing app development right.",positive
8209,Really helpful. I like that I get reminders in the morning about what's on my agenda for the day. I like that I can check them off and they move to the bottom of the lotst as they are completed. I like that it reminds me later in the day to revisit my list. Easy to use.,positive
8210,It is the best app i ever downloaded to keep track of things that needs to be done. Im a proctastinator/ forgetful and know how hard it is to get things done. But this app eliminates the hassle of forgetting tasks.,positive
8211,"I love this app, is very simple to use, yoh can set the time for reminders. Is not annoying and I totally recommend to use it. The only thing I would like to improve, is to put first the task you havend comple.",positive
8212,"Perfect App for what it is made for, I even.purchased premium so I could add more habits and also get the dark mode option. I am a Music Producer and if anybody does any form of creative art for a living then you will know how easy it is to get carried away and spend hours doing that. This app has helped me to stay on top of other tasks such as eating healthy spending time with my pets and going to the gym everyday. So Thank You!!! God Bless and have a great day. Instagram: AV_TheArtist",positive
8213,"It is a very nice app,it remixes you and you will never miss any task,it reminds you with alarm or notification, it really helped me.",positive
8214,"I love the app, and the widget is very useful. It's also nice to have my tasks and habits in the one place. Only feature I've found to be missing so far is to start the week on a Monday instead of a Sunday",positive
8215,"Awesome app. I now remember to take my medication, drink my water, and have my to do list. It has been extremely helpful and productive.",positive
8216,"I was reluctant at first to use this app but now absolutely love it. It's simple yet effective to track your habits and keep on top of to-do list. Truly one of the best app I have used (& I seldom say or write any comments). However, just one niggly point would be the alarm where it doesn't seem to do anything even if I choose to have alarm on the Reminder function. If this could be resolved, it would be awesome and would just go premium!",positive
8217,Great simple app. I wish it easily sync'd across devices. I also would love a calendar view I can see/print so I can visually see my progress over time.,positive
8218,App is great in terms of tracking or developing a habit and has great customizations for each. I loved the option of reminder but very dissapointed that it never works. I never get any notifications or reminders.,positive
8219,This app is simple and effective! I totally love the reminders to complete my tasks and goals! Being able to look back at the calendar and see where i suceeded is awesome!,positive
8220,I am really appreciating these reminders and the ability to track my progress!!! It has a lot of customizable options and it is easy to use. Highly recommend,positive
8221,"VERY GOOD and far better than most of the similar apps that I have tried so far. It would be great if weekly schedule could be added for an specific habit, so you could be reminded at different times during different days of the week; which sounds more functional and reasonable as we usually don't have a fixed routine during the week. Needless to say what a big improvement a companion smart watch app would be!",positive
8222,"I really like it! It is easy to use, it doesn't take a lot of time, just check and follow your new habits. Me encanta! Fácil de usar y no toma mucho tiempo revisar y hacerle seguimiento a tus nuevos hábitos.",positive
8223,"Functional, does everything I want it to do, versatile and allows for both habits and one-off tasks. The only improvement I want to make is changing the colours of the completion status icons.",positive
8224,"Love it! Has really helped me focus and complete tasks all the way through, if only so I get to check them off and maintain my completion percentage",positive
8225,Bought premium. Exactly what I was looking for. Amazing job and what I need to help me in life. Giving it 5 stars even though I have one suggestion. Possibly have it where you can have a single habit occur twice. Like say example I want work out but I want to work out at 3pm and 7pm. I saw another app have it but still this one is best hands down.,positive
8226,"Best app, only few changes please. In the edit option can't seem to change first date and repeat interval. Please add full editing same as when making a habit or task. Thank you",positive
8227,This app is exactly what I need to to be. It helps me keep track of the habits I'm trying to establish without being too intrusive. I've already recommended it to a number of my friends.,positive
8228,I really love this app so far. It would be nice though if a habit/task would disappear from the widget list when completed for the day. It would make a better sense of accomplishment.,positive
8229,Really good app and well built with nice user interface. They also have good customer service and they replyed quickly to my earlier review where I was experiencing a problem at first.,positive
8230,This app is outstanding! I love dark mode so I upgraded to premium & it's 100% worth it. Excellent app. Great to organize & motivate yourself. Thank you,positive
8231,Only starting but it is a good little app so far! Easy to use and does what it needs to; will see how it goes :),positive
8232,It was really awesome.This is what I was looking for. I can track all my habits and task and also can see the history. I am notified in time. Having a good time with this app. The theme is also nice. Really loved it.,positive
8233,"For those looking to manage their habits and tasks in one APP, HabitNow is just for you. No mpre need to sketch trackers that aren'y as nearly accessible as your phone.",positive
8234,This app is working really well for me. Definitely helping me stay on track with habits I'm working to build and stop!,positive
8235,"Im in love with this app! Simple to use , beautiful layout and keep me on track!",positive
8236,Respected Brother Very nice app. Premium payment must be by other means as well and your contact details.,positive
8237,"It's perfect. I've made excellent progress on my newly formed habits and I meet every task, thanks to this app.",positive
8238,"Best habit app I have tried, love the flexibility, task list and look. Good job!",positive
8239,This app has most features for a free habit tracker and even the onetime payment is the cheapest in this category. The habit tracker of choice.,positive
8240,Simple and effective! I really enjoy the unobtrusive way of making sure you log your data,positive
8241,"As a teenager,it is very crucial to manage time,habits and tasks.This is one app which allowed me to do so.My saying for this app is that it would control what you do in a day by its limit.",positive
8242,Love this !!! A simple easy way to keep me on track during the day!!,positive
8243,I am really enjoying this app so far! It's just what I was looking for to keep myself on a routine. And the price is great!,positive
8244,This is a perfect app for tracking and building habits! :),positive
8245,Very useful for keeping myself accountable for daily tasks and goals that I want to accomplish.,positive
8246,HabitNow is a great app. Well thought out and the colours are good! No dark mode in free version but I don't see that as a reason to give less than 5 stars. Has helped me to organise aspects of my life.,positive
8247,User friendly. Simple but it has all the function I need.,positive
8248,"Very organized, simple, just what I was looking for in order to keep my daily tasks organized.",positive
8249,Perfect app for both making habit and tracking tasks. Would be a complete app if they provide sync just only with Google account for free.,positive
8250,This app is great for helping to establish new habits and keep you on track with goals and tasks you want to accomplish.,positive
8251,Really easy to use. You can go back to catch up on habits you left unfinished for previous days,positive
8252,Wish you could enter info/ data in past. I was trying to move from one app to another. I had to take screenshots. Great app though especially reminder alarm! Update i can set past start date. Thank you!,positive
8253,Bought the premium version and now I actually have healthy routines in my life which is A LOT for an adult with ADHD !,positive
8254,Great app as I can have a record of habits I want to instill in my self and daily tasks that need to be done,positive
8255,Great app! Been wanting a routine type ap for awhile definitely nice to have for my schedual!,positive
8256,This is the best app I've ever seen to help with achieving your goals. It's so awesome and really well set out.,positive

8258,Great app. Very user-friendly and practical. Thanks,positive

8288,"tried all habit tracker apps, it's the best one yet. just please add an option to the calendar icon so i can see all the habits & tasks together at the calendar & read their notes or success / failure rate. keep up the good work.",positive

8290,Great app! Been wanting a routine type ap for awhile definitely nice to have for my schedual!,positive
8291,Respected Brother Very nice app. Premium payment must be by other means as well and your contact details.,positive
8292,Very useful for keeping myself accountable for daily tasks and goals that I want to accomplish.,positive
8293,This app has a great way to keep up with and manage your life. It keeps me organized and inspired to heal myself daily.,positive
8294,"Great habit, task and to-do list tracker",positive
8295,"Excellent if you use it properly. The only thing I would change is the notification and alarms settings. I want notifications to come through even when I'm not actively looking at the app. Right now, I'm not notified until I open the app and the pop-ups show up.",positive

8308,Genial aplicacion,positive
8309,At last I get what I want... Thanks..,positive
8310,"Honestly great. Simple. Effective. 1 time purchase. The UI has a sort of dated look but it's very quick and easy to use. Most of my daily habits vary alot based on which day it is, my schedule varies so much I cant put them on a specifik time, and I almost always do them in the same order. Therefore there should be an option to change the order of the habits manually, yourself, without any variables. :)",positive
8311,Excellent,positive
8312,Really simple and good application. Good job guys,positive
8313,Great simple app. I wish it easily sync'd across devices. I also would love a calendar view I can see/print so I can visually see my progress over time.,positive
8314,Exactly what I was looking for to help establish routines. I like that I can set it to place habits on certain days and don't manually have to readd them. My only suggestion is to be able to manually sort items,positive
8315,Second day of usuing. Above my spectation,positive
8316,The developers got back to me within minutes and helped me sort the problem out within a very short period thank you support! Widget was being blocked by battery optimizer. *previous review *Paid for premium however the feature to mark complete on the widget is not working. Will do 5 star if this can be resolved.,positive

8319,"The best app in the market for improving your daily habits. I researched many Habit apps in Play store and finally concluded that this is the best one. I changed my self a lot by regulary monitoring my habits through HabitNow App. The user interface is superb and quite simple. Also it provides habit statistics up to date.

8345,Very useful app for many thing to avoid bad habits🤗🤗,positive
8346,Great job,positive
8347,"I'm trying to develop some healthy habits, and this app is very good at reminding me to do things. The only complaint I have is that you can't actually organize your tasks and habits. I try to organize them by time and they don't move. I have a habit for 12pm listed after one for 3am, which is preceded by 4pm. This is very frustrating when you want to look at things in order. That's why I'm docking 1⭐. I like the function of it and I like the widget. Update: 1⭐ restored- thank you for helping!",positive

8352,Has helped me stay accountable and prioritize things that I really want to do!,positive
8353,I love this app so much it has really helped me get into a morning and night time routine. Before I found this app I was always late for school and felt really unhealthy in myself. But now I'm I'm always early for school and make sure I wake up every morning at the right time thank you to this app so much,positive
8354,Very good app,positive
8355,"I got this app to track my medication and it's perfect! I can set up how I want to take each medicine (yes/no or quantity), see the start date and adherence in the summary view, and even track side effects and effectiveness each day then see them in a chronological list in the sunmary. And the best part is that it's not tied to some medical database! Added bonus: I can track real to-dos as well. Overall, love this app!",positive
8356,If you want a digital checklist to keep you on top of your life then this is the app to use!,positive
8357,"Functional, does everything I want it to do, versatile and allows for both habits and one-off tasks. The only improvement I want to make is changing the colours of the completion status icons.",positive
8358,Such a amazing app. Keep track of ur life.,positive
8359,"I love this app, is very simple to use, yoh can set the time for reminders. Is not annoying and I totally recommend to use it. The only thing I would like to improve, is to put first the task you havend comple.",positive
8360,A good tool to manage and remind me of my tasks,positive
8361,Good,positive
8362,I am really appreciating these reminders and the ability to track my progress!!! It has a lot of customizable options and it is easy to use. Highly recommend,positive
8363,I've been using this app for a week and so far it is great! It has really helped me hold myself accountable for habits that I want to break or start. Way better than I thought. I never end up liking self help apps. I also never write reviews. Give the one a chance.,positive
8364,Wonderful app😍,positive
8365,Great app for tracking habits.,positive
8366,Very nice app.,positive
8367,This app is outstanding! I love dark mode so I upgraded to premium & it's 100% worth it. Excellent app. Great to organize & motivate yourself. Thank you,positive

8374,Very good. Considering going premium.,positive
8375,Really good app and well built with nice user interface. They also have good customer service and they replyed quickly to my earlier review where I was experiencing a problem at first.,positive
8376,Great habit tracking app. Very clean and simple interface. Fantastically elegant design. Other habit tracking apps are not as user friendly. I contacted the developers on a couple of concerns I had and they were already working on these features to be added in future updates.,positive
8377,"It's perfect. I've made excellent progress on my newly formed habits and I meet every task, thanks to this app.",positive
8378,Love this !!! A simple easy way to keep me on track during the day!!,positive

8382,Best app for habits track and tasks I ever used. Highly recommend! Easy to use.,positive
8383,"I can't say enough good things about the app and the dev and support teams. Super stable, lots of great features, and the most responsive support team I've worked with personally or professionally. Invest in this app! You'll love it and you'll support a company that is doing app development right.",positive
8384,Just woww!!!,positive
8385,This app is working really well for me. Definitely helping me stay on track with habits I'm working to build and stop!,positive
8386,This is terrible compared to wunderlist. I use wunderlist to sync my family's repeating chores. I was used to clicking 'today' and having everything there and in folders that needed to be done past and present. Now i have to choose what i do everyday! Also if i skip a task and want to reset it to today so it can repeat in 2 weeks it retains the day so repeats in less than two weeks. And the folders? What's the point in having folders if you can't sort by them in any list?Is there an alternative?,negative
8387,"The app looks nice, but being forced to move over from Wunderlist, the import data functionality only working after the 5th try (after two weeks) and the web version literally becoming unresponsive when I load it, tells me this app is not in any way finished or ready to be used. I don't trust it to not lose my data, so I can't use it. Thankfully, other apps can import from Wunderlist as well...",negative
8388,"This app is terrible compared to wunderlist especially if you like the functionality to share a list with another. We cannot seem to get the shareable feature to work. Additionally, even though I'm logged in with the same account on my laptop and phone., it doesn't sync lists. New items are added to the bottom of a list instead of the top. Microsoft has a lot of work to do to get this where it needs to be.",negative
8389,"When Microsoft announced they were killing Wunderlist, my expectations for the New Thing were soooo low. I was spot on. Bloody hell its it's awful. Look how wunderlist works. 1. new items are added to the top 2. completed items are struck through _and_ moved to the bottom, and remain in completed order. 3. highlighted items are bounced to the top, which can then be un-highlighted. 4. items with low importance remain at the end. With _long_ lists old un-completed or permanent items migrate to the end of the list. Try a usability test with LONG lists.",negative
8390,"Be very careful. This syncs with your tasks in Outlook. At first that sounds great, until you find out that if you use any feature of Outlook that isn't in this app (regenerating tasks after completion for example), your tasks are OVERWRITTEN in Outlook with ones compatible with this app, resulting in loss of things like due dates. I lost all my regenerating tasks, replaced by occurring tasks instead, causing so many items to be late. If you use any kind of advanced Outlook tasks, don't use.",negative
8391,"Horrible! So many steps!...Set a due date, set a reminder, set it to display in My Day. The reminder set screen is 2 different screens for date/time. The My Day section is the only way you can organize by reminder time for scheduling purposes. Once it's in My Day you must manually move the items in time sequence. Takes up way too much time to organize your day! Importing did not work after several attempts. The setting reset themselves to default after I set them.",negative
8392,"As a long time user of Wunderlist, this new replacement fails at the single most important thing next to holding taks: remind the user of said tasks. If a task comes up as due, I expect it to stay in notifications until I clear the task. Instead, To Do decided there's a time limit on how long a reminder stays on your notifications which means it isn't reminding you anymore which forces you to remember to open the app to see your tasks. This completely defeats the purpose of a reminder.",negative
8393,"Was forced to migrate from Wunderlist. My husband and I both used Wunderlist extensively - sharing and updating lists. When we were force to migrate over, it migrated everything except the lists were not shared anymore. So when I updated my list, it does not update his list. I reshaped that list and it created a duplicate list for him. This is extremely annoying because we have to reshare EVERYTHING.",negative
8394,"This is my first time giving a review on any App I've downloaded. This App is a huge downgrade from the now defunct Wunderlist. The fact that you need to use a Microsoft account is annoying but to add insult to injury you can't even share the lists normally with people ""Outside your organisation"" (what ever that means) so now all I have is a glorified sticky note... I mean had, I'm erasing this app the second I finish this review.",negative
8395,"Real hassle to set up with synchronization with others. I cannot work out what the small red number on the icon relates to and cannot get rid of it, with wunderlist it related to completed tasks and once these were viewed the number disappeared. I much preferred wunderlist which worked fine. Why won't Microsoft leave well alone? I do not need this app to run my life, just keep lists which can be mine or shared.",negative
8396,"Terrible, Wunderlist worked well, nothing seems to work now, transitioning was not easy, I had to set up an account I don't want and don't need. I am not happy, Microsoft has not done well with making things user-friendly for some time now, I wouldn't be surprised if they don't start stealing everyone's information and using it without ""consent"" like apple does. Oh wait, I can't tell the difference between any of these companies now, and I am pretty sure they all do that and don't care! GFY!",negative
8397,Bad transfer from Wunderlist. Resharing lists is time consuming. Order of items on lists is not preserved. Looks like it at first until you add something to a list and then it appears at the end/bottom of the list not at the top. Must then sort by order of creation date which throws everything out of wack if you had items ordered by importance or any other custom order.,negative
8398,"Wunderlist is way better and simpler. Why is this so complicated??? I dont need another complicated app to update that is hard to read. Just copy wunderlist exactly. I dont need 4 categories (my day, tasks, etc.). All I want is one area to see all things due today or overdue not a bunch of extra list to sort through.",negative
8399,"I almost never leave reviews but for this transition I have to make an exception. Wunderlist has been my most frequently used App, being in daily use to manage my busy days. The ToDo version is hopeless to use. I like to use a weekly list which no longer exists. It's replacement does not allow drag and drop to different days. Worse, if you manually change the date of a task it doesn't move to the new day. It remains in the original day with a completion different date. Must be fixed!",negative
8400,"Wunderlist was better. Microsoft bought it and killed it. First, Microsoft forced me to switch apps. Now I have to have two accounts since I have lists at both home and work that I share with others. Pretty dumb. Otherwise, the app IS Wunderlist. Waste of time to have to redo everything.",negative
8401,"Can you make it exactly like wunderlist,I work every day with wunderlist and 'to do' momentarily doesn't help my needs!!! Four example,when a chose to have a list for today,i have to drag them from bottom to up,they don't go themselves,and when i click something,finish, it still stay there,there is no delimitation line!if you will do all of this later,than I retrieve my word,till then you should let wunderlist open.Thank you.",negative
8402,"I have hope that this app will get a lot closer to the superior Wunderlist so I'll change my review when it does, but for now here are my biggest concerns: I really don't like how 'my day' doesn't automatically include things due 'today'. Also when moving a task to a list it's annoying because the lists are not shown under their folders. I'd also like to see a 'my week feature'. Also two lists can't have the same name even though I have them in different folders.",negative
8403,"Not impressed considering the size of the owner. Loses entire days worth of data if refreshed as prompted to ""apply update"". Shows lists differently on mobile app. Can't order some lists. Painfully slow to sync between devices when compared to ANY checklist app available. Annoyed since I switched from Wunderlist when Microsoft started ruining it.",negative
8404,I had to migrate from Wunderlist and I mentioned a couple of compromises that had to be made due to less functionality. Anyway today I discover that you cannot print or email your lists. Surely those are basic requirements. This should have been thought out and a replacement system should at least be on par with the system its replacing,negative
8405,"I like what its trying to do and want to use it, but it's missing a few things. To-Do doesn't support formatting AT ALL (mobile or PC), and any formatting you do in Outlook is erased and spacing is messed up. To-Do has the ability to create subtasks but doesn't translate over to Outlook. The To-Do app on PC doesn't allow you to enlarge the task/note window so your forced to type in this little box on the side of the window. PLEASE FIX THESE!!",negative
8406,"For years we used Wunderlist, for work, including employees without corporate accounts, for family, outside organisation and across continents. ToDo failed from the get go, but to be fair, so do most other tasklist apps, we tried many. We finally moved to Trello - A bit different to Wunderlist and not quite as intuitive, but works across platforms, across organisations. It sadly seems MS loves to destroy good things. Wunderlist was such a good product, we were really sad to see it go.",negative
8407,Wunderlist was better!! Please change the UI back to Wlist style which makes it easier to read. For example don't have completed and non completed tasks right next to each other in a list. Also comments needs to be separated automatically with a date specified that states which date that comment was added and by who,negative
8408,"Very sad story of being Wunderlist ancestor. Missing Drag and Drop Missing UX at all Missing ease of using Creating of new task requires your full attention for several painful seconds. App that was meant to make your life easy is now just some list that force me to write my tasks on paper again after few years of using Wunderlist, because paper has much better UX than this one.",negative
8409,"I don't like that I was able to link my account through Wunderlist and my Gmail but my husband is being promoted to create a Microsoft account to have access. If I am going to have to create a Microsoft account,I will be deleting this app. I don't want/need another account to manage. Wunderlist was much better.",negative
8410,"Any Microsoft product should have zero stars available. I cannot say strongly enough, if you love crashes, frustration and impossibly awful software. . . then get this app. Imports from Wunderlist do not stay put, they disappeared. Shared lists are now two different lists with the same name. One version shows only completed tasks, my fone shows incomplete. Thanks Bill for your 100% record of ruining everything you buy. Oh and 4.5 stars out of five?? I call BS. Look at the reviews.",negative
8411,"Does not import from Wunderlist. Very disappointed with having to switch. We've been using Wunderlist for some time and it's been great and without issues. Now we're forced to switch over and when I follow the instructions, keep getting the 'nothing to import message'. This is very frustrating. Developers please fix asap!",negative
8412,"Wunderlist was just fine. Why the same in a new jacket done worse. Just because it has to be Microsoft? Microsoft, stop trying to be what others do better. Edge, why? Bing, why? Buy a good working app and make it worse, again. Why? As a UX designer to MS Business: stop trying to outperform others who already are market leaders. Start finding new solutions for new user problems and be the market leader there. If not, a Google will outperform you, because they understand user problems better.",negative
8413,"Tells me it can't import all my data and to retry. But when I retry, it tells me everything is up to date and there's nothing to import! Of course the one list that's missing is the only one that's important... I'll be trying another app, thanks but no thanks.",negative
8414,"Microsoft bought an already mature application, spent 4 years working on it, and this is all they have to show for it??? Perhaps they could add more technical resources to support the 2 high school students that currently support this product. Poorly integrated with Outlook. Simple... too simple. Has very few features or functionality.",negative
8415,"I hate it! I loved wunnderlist, it was just perfect. Why did you guys have to change what was great??? This new App is so unclear, things don't stand out the way they did. I imported all my info from wunderlist and it is all messed up. I will be looking for another app and give up on you asap!",negative
8416,"Uselss. Forced here from wunderlist closing, my whole family used that, now all our lists are different, doesnt sync accross shared lists, defeats the purpose altogether. Also a more contrived interface, im now off searching for a better alternative to start all over again as this ain't it.",negative
8417,"From the terrible Microsoft design to the fact of missing crucial features, especially in comparison to Wunderlist, and the fact that Microsoft only bought Wunderlist to shut it down... This piece of software actually had to overwhelm people to overcome the unfriendly Microsoft strategy, but here we are, letting us all down. Go to ticktick or smth else. Microsoft does not deserve our attention on this one :(",negative
8418,"Loved Wunderlist, was excited about the over all design and compatibility with Microsoft now in charge. Unfortunately I haven't been able to join any lists or have anyone join my lists. Which is the entire point of this app for me... hope to see this fixed...",negative
8419,"I wanted to delete one item, pressed a millimetre too low, the whole list is gone. About a hundred items lost. This alone makes the whole app unusable for me. Months later: still this same fatal flaw. Seems like MS have no interest in improving this app, sadly",negative
8420,"Forced to migrate from Wunderlist. Why can't the developers just keep basic features such as adding an item to the top of the list? (instead of bottom) I also miss the Today view where tasks are organised by Category instead of Date. Urgh.. Going to look for another app. Sorry Microsoft, you ruined the app for me.",negative
8421,I've been told that Wunderlist is being replaced by Microsoft To Do. What a sad replacement! Why on earth are they mucking up a great product for this? The whole look and feel of the app is terrible. The functioning of the app has changed too. Good bye from a long standing user.,negative
8422,"Switched from Wunderlist and the widget will occasionally not load the contents. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Very frustrating to use. Wunderlist never had any of these problems.",negative
8423,"Add a way to change the color scheme of the app. Blue on white is one of the most difficult colour sets to see. You bought wunderlist, and are making everyone change over to it. At least give us the option to reskin the app.",negative
8424,"Wunderlist was better. Shared my list with my husband and it won't sync or show up when one of us changes something. It shows us both on the list but when he deleted an item, it didn't show as deleted on mine after refreshing five times.",negative
8425,"I was not planning to give a review but it left me no choice since its replacing wunderlist which is very useful app which my wife and I love especially for our grocery lists, now this TO DO tries to replace it but can't even get it to work properly!!! IF I CAN GIVE ZERO STAR, I WOULD!!!",negative
8426,Tried to share a list with my girlfriend who has a personal Microsoft account and I have an office 365 account. Can't do it... Need to have two personal accounts or be in the same organization. Bring back Wunderlist or similar functionality.,negative

8430,"You can't choose week starts day. Calendar is a basis. Additional customization looks reasonable. Moreover, MS support marked this request as ""in progress"" . But 2!!! years ago. Is it a joke?",negative
8431,"This is awful!! bring back wunderlist ! You cant move your list around to the you want, this is beyond frustrating. Not happy you are forcing us to stop wunderlist Will have to investigate else where for a better list app.",negative
8432,Sync is broken! We have been using for a year or so. Now sync between two people simply doesn't work. Microsoft have destroyed a great app! What did you do? It worked perfectly before!,negative
8433,Please delay shutting down Wunderlist. Those who most rely on task lists cannot deal with a switch during this global crisis. Especially since To Do is still lacking important features and sync and sharing are inconsistent.,negative

8437,It took me a while to login because of terrible security checking. And after it suggested to migrate all the data from Wunderlist without option to cancel. Terrible beginning.,negative
8438,"Terrible. Won't sync, utterly disastrous transfer from wunderlist. Gutted that wunderlist is going and being replaced by something so inferior. Will have to look for a new list app now :-(",negative

This then reverts everything back to the same unsorted mess prior to the selected sort option. Very frustrating.",negative

I like this out because it syncs between android and my macbook pro. works a charm. only issue - doesn't handle recurring tasks such as ""recurs on the second tuesday of the month. ..."" etc. simple recurring tasks are fine (every second monday). overall very good. easy to use. Once recurring tasks are implemented completely this will be superior!",neutral
8792,"Mostly really good, great for sharing tasks between people/phones/desktops, but the widgets on Android keep clearing themselves and have to be re-added to work again, and repeating tasks constantly change the day they alert you on, reminding me the day after or before I set them to.

I'm unsure as to what Microsoft has changed from the ""Wunderlist"" app that I've been forced to switch from, but this app does not work as quickly and nicely as wunderlist did, which I had been using for 2 to 3 years constantly because it worked so well. Please revise this app so that connectivity problems from servers can be solved. I am unable to sync some/all of my shared lists.",neutral
8794,"ok, but feels like untested alpha state software. tricky to navigate quickly when called from a widget, direct call entry for phone calls seems to be missing (though that's the first thing one needs in a todo list), sorting tasks is either impossible or a well hidden feature, sharing and assigning is very rudimentary.",neutral
8795,"Not happy with the switch from Wunderlist. Why did you remove the option to assign a list to a group at the time you are creating a new list? It is cumbersome and time consuming to have to drag the list to a new group, especially when you have numerous groups and lists as I do and I move them often. What a pain!",neutral
8796,"Coming from Wunderlist, I am disappointed. So much wasted space in the user interface and no way to make elements smaller. The overall look is also less slick. It really is a ""to do"" app while I'm looking for a listing app. Will have to find an alternative.",neutral
8797,"I miss the Today, Week & All shortcuts that Wunderlist had at the top. The Planned replacement is not as easy to view or follow my week ahead at a glance. The automated transfer seems to have worked well so far. UPDATE: Sharing lists previously shared with my wife now creates a double so that needs to be fixed ASAP. Wunderlist would randomly delete scheduled reminders in bulk, hopefully To Do has put a stop to that.",neutral

All of my 'created dates' for items in my list got wiped amd set to the current month day and year of when I did the import a couple days ago.

This is as of build #151.",neutral
8800,"Its good. The only thing that is missing is the time inclusion. Like at what time a particular task is planned. If that can be added, it would be perfect. It would be like a personal calendar and activity planner together. I hope that can be added.",neutral

I'd give a 5 star rating if Microsoft To-Do added new items to the top of the list, not the bottom, and allow you to move any item to the top by pressing the ""star"" on that item, similar to Wunderlist. Needless to say, I'm gonna be using this app a whole lot less than I had used Wunderlist, until this is fixed. It's a huge inconvenience for me to have to keep dragging each new item to the top of my lists, which tend to be VERY long.",neutral

8834,It replaced Wunderlist but actually the functionality was down graded . Sharing is done with a link instead of directly with a contact,neutral

Also can't customize ""smart lists"" that are stuck at the top. My Day and Tasks? That's the same thing for me, either let me put it at the bottom or let me remove them. Microsoft took Wunderlist and ruined it.",neutral
8836,Not as good as Wunderlist. Simple things make it less usable than its predecessor such as: 1. sharing internet page to a list and the list defaults to My Day instead of one of your choice or the last one you opened - makes adding lots of pages in a row slow. 2. Add new task from the widget puts it at the bottom of the list not the top. 3. Marking a task with a star doesn't move it to the top of the list.

8849,"As a to do list it works ok. Devs need to allow manual sorting of priority though. I think this app has much greater potential if it were to be integrated with Outlook including meetings & appointments along with tasks becoming more of an overall assistant rather than a to do list. One major gripe though, the point type on the widget is miniscule and barely readable.",neutral
8850,I really miss some stuff what is available in Wunderlist: 1) All the tasks in different lists that is available in the general TASK list (not only.planned tasks) 2) The option to show new task on top of list 3) Option to move important tasks to the top 4) Option to show task for the WEEK. Bring that ib and you will definitly get a 5,neutral
8851,"Good app but I like Wunderlist better. Microsoft should have changed the name of Wunderlist to Microsoft To Do, added their integrations, updated the program inline with user requests and it would be Great! The My Day feature is odd since I plan my day the night before so My Day events are gone the day I actually need them. I don' use My Day any longer, instead I use Important and Planner as a replacement for My Day and I use Task as an inbox.",neutral

Not customizable either. Please improve it",neutral
8855,"Gave it a chance. Still quite raw. No proper planning and no way to see all tasks at once. Please take some inspiration from Any.Do. Win10 store application however is epic, the best. Very bad that there is no tomorrow, and incomplete tasks from my day, disappear.",neutral

The combination of the 2 make it impossible to stay organized. I hope they fix this stuff soon, I don't see any reason why this isn't already a feature.",neutral
8933,"The app is great, and I´ve started to use it rather than wunderlist. Just 3 stars because I don´t think the My Day section makes sense. Tasks flagged as to be done today, in others lists, should appear in My Day, as those are the tasks for Today, seems My Day only considers tasks added specifically to that list, and that makes it confusing and redundant, as in Planned, the right logic is applied, where you see planned tasks for today and ahead. Shouldn´t the same logic apply to the My Day window? Or I am doing something wrong?",neutral
8934,"Much prefer the look/layout of Wunderlist. Lots of little things in To Do that aren't as good as Wunderlist and it's a huge shame that it is being retired for this. As a minimum, everyone should have the option of making it look exactly the same so we don't notice the difference. As it is, the text is too big, extra items that can't be turned off such as 'My Day' clutter the screen and it just doesn't look/feel as good. Shame",neutral

When the link is clicked on it states that the ""List Is Not Available Now"" and """"It's not you. It's us."" Then I read that members have to be on the same account. I like the new ToDo but I have tasks and lists assigned to others but no way to communicate that.",neutral

In big industry companies is not alowed to install anything, what is not fully authorized by central IT department.

8954,Widget is not informative. It shows a text of a task but not date and time. That is not comfortable. User has to open task to see when it is scheduled. Google Tasks widget is much better in this case.,neutral

8956,"I don't mind the switch from Wunderlist, but To Do is missing the thing I use most...which is the list of things I have to do today It was so much easier in Wunderlist Everything else is basically the same but I see no benefit to changing this most fundamental of features in wunderlist",neutral

8973,Not bad but Wunderlist is better. Like Wunderlist graphics and layout better. Want folders to be collapsed or even better a setting that lets me choose.,neutral
8974,It's very basic. Why doesn't it have a calendar view if i want to take a look at my week? Overall nice interface though,neutral

8987,"Good but could be better. It works well and is very similar to Wunderlist, however it's very annoying that the reminders disappear from the notification bar if you haven't completed your task in a day. So you have to reschedule every day. Would be great if this could be fixed.",neutral

9160,"I'm trying to add a task, press ""add button"" (the arrow) and the task just disappeares. Quite simple functionality and even this with bugs",neutral
9161,"The app looks very ok but it lacks help or support portal. I have accidently hidden the smart list like the planned, how can I unhide them and also how can I assign task to my colleagues or employees?",neutral
9162,"There's a bug where I can't add tasks from the widget. Tasks only get added if I actually open the app. Pixel 3a. Also items get added to the bottom of the list by default. What the hell, Microsoft?",neutral
9163,"Longtime Wunderlist user. Slowly getting used to the ToDo app. So far it is ok. There are still some features that were not included from Wunderlist such as when a task is checked as completed, it has to be manually moved into a folder I created called Completed Tasks. In Wunderlist a completed task was automatically moved to a completed task folder. Would like to see this executed in ToDo. Thank you",neutral
9164,"When trying to add from the widget, it does not add to the selected list, instead it adds to tasks. Very annoying. This makes the widget borderline useless.",neutral
9165,"Update: The accidental deletion problem described below is compounded by my now finding a ""confirm before deleting"" setting that simply does not work. The app is nice, but when starring or opening a list item it's easy to delete it. That's because deleting happens when you slide an item left, and that can happen by accident. Either add a working setting to optionally require confirmations of deletes, or provide a trash can from which you can recover deleted items.",neutral
9166,"Being constantly prompted to ""Share List!"" Is a big pain in the butt. My wife and I share our info with each other, and it's a big nag that may cause us to abandon MS todo.",neutral
9167,This is all well and good but it doesn't tell me how to use To Do to do anything. Like making separate list or subcategories for each list?,neutral
9168,Wish they add : copy paste function Remind specified time before due date options,neutral
9169,For some reason I can't exit the app which I press the back button on Lenovo Yoga Smart Tab (only home or app-switch buttons) Please fix,neutral
9170,Cool app but widgets stopped working so makes it pointless to keep,neutral
9171,no integration with google assistant =(,neutral
9172,"Good app but I like Wunderlist better. Microsoft should have changed the name of Wunderlist to Microsoft To Do, added their integrations, updated the program inline with user requests and it would be Great! The My Day feature is odd since I plan my day the night before so My Day events are gone the day I actually need them. I don' use My Day any longer, instead I use Important and Planner as a replacement for My Day and I use Task as an inbox.",neutral
9173,Informative but extremely slow.,neutral
9174,"Not as useful as Wunderlist... Yet!! Would prefer to have a tab for the ""week"". Not just day, that way I can anticipate. Also wish items would show up in my calendar.",neutral
9175,"Microsoft forces you to use your Microsoft account to use it, then never keeps you logged in long enough to get notifications. Sharing via text feels like I'm back on my Droid phone, and trying to get updates to shared lists suffers from the forced log outs as well. Also can't customize ""smart lists"" that are stuck at the top. My Day and Tasks? That's the same thing for me, either let me put it at the bottom or let me remove them. Microsoft took Wunderlist and ruined it.",neutral
9176,"Repeating tasks seriously need to be automatically added to 'My Day' view on their due date, each time. It would also be useful if there's an additional option to automatically delete completed tasks, instead of just hiding them.",neutral
9177,"User-friendly. STEPS and GROUPS are smart features! Options for repeat reminder are comprehensive. Love the colors! Suggestions: 1. Retain THEME COLOR for TASK. So when opening Planned, easier to distunguish which tasks are under Acads, Orgs, etc. 2. A better font style for tasks. 3. PLANNED. Please classify Next Week to specific days. It will also be great if I will be able to move tasks from Today to Tuesday next week with a press, hold, and swipe. Automatically updates the due date.",neutral
9178,"So close to being perfect, Missing -Tags -filters -reports Will definitely be keeping an eye out for these!",neutral
9179,Nice app. However one important feature missing in App is you can not assign the task to some other person. This feature is there in desktop version and very useful in corporate environment.,neutral
9180,Needs option to sort by due date AND time. Should be able to set some tasks/items to move into next day automatically. Should have custom sort or dedicated grocery store shopping list option so you can sort items by how they're arranged in the store. Please add these options & this would be the best to do app ever!,neutral
9181,Bigger fonts at widget plz!! Connect One Drive with to do & Outlook Calendar too !!!!,neutral
9182,"I'm giving it three stars right now til I know how to properly use all the features, but so far it's the best app I've used so far. You can organize lists for home and work and other things so it's not confusing and easy to set dates",neutral
9183,"It's just okay. I much preferred Wunderlist. I'd give a 5 star rating if Microsoft To-Do added new items to the top of the list, not the bottom, and allow you to move any item to the top by pressing the ""star"" on that item, similar to Wunderlist. Needless to say, I'm gonna be using this app a whole lot less than I had used Wunderlist, until this is fixed. It's a huge inconvenience for me to have to keep dragging each new item to the top of my lists, which tend to be VERY long.",neutral
9184,Not working on my chromebook. I cannot open any lists to view the contents. EDIT: Issue seems to be resolved in the latest update. Though still only giving 3 stars since this is taking over wunderlists but is still comparatively lacking in design and ease of use.,neutral
9185,"It's finally getting better, although still doesn't measure up to Wunderlist. But the latest update broke the widget! Please fix!",neutral
9186,"I loved wunderlist. For the most part, I also like To Do and think they've done a good job transferring things over. One feature I do not like is that the Today list has to be made the day of. I like to make my ""today"" list the night before--makes it easier to plan and be prepared. When I do that now, I wake up in the AM and my list isn't visible.",positive
9187,"Sure could use a ""completed tasks"" tab. I hide my completed tasks in tabs as it just gets messy and when I wanna check what is done, I gotta manually untick the ""hide completed"" and then tick it again. I'd also appreciate if you could see when the task was completed. Overall a great multiplatform tool, been using it since I found it.",positive
9188,I came across from Wunderlist and it does everything I need it to do except for one really annoying feature - on Wunderlist when you added a new item you had the option for it to go to the top or bottom of the list. I always want my newest entries to go to the top (especially in very long lists) as they are the things I want to action first. Include a simple option to allow this and your app will do everything Wunderlist did and I will be a happy man!,positive
9189,"For those coming from Wunderlist: To transfer your data, log on to a computer (not a phone or tablet) to transfer your data if you're having transfer trouble. Seems similar to the glory that was Wunderlist. But still not as good.",positive
9190,Love this app! Didn't think I could find something as good as Wunderlist but this app is better! Just a couple of things would make it perfect. Option to change font size and option to add new items to top of list.,positive
9191,"Very good... Excellent features. Especially for the subtask, the option to add step for achieving the task/subtask. Kindly add a calendar feature to get an overview of what is ahead. Also, some ready made quick reminders like a call, payment, email, a template for grocery, etc would add cheery to the cake",positive
9192,I was using Wunderlist but this seems to be a great replacement. It integrates very well with Outlook 365 and the reminders are easy to manage. Would certainly recommend it for anyone looking to manage task lists.,positive
9193,"Pretty good app, lets you organize tasks by categories, prioritize based on due dates and set reminders for each specific task. However, sometimes, reminders fail to notify you in the specified time and come rather delayed.",positive
9194,I love that I can break a task into steps. I didnt like that they moved the completed task button from the bottom of list to side menu. All in all it is a good tool and it has improved a lot since I started using it.,positive
9195,It's a great app almost providing everything you want for free not like other apps. I just wish if there was a timer beside each task you do such that you can spend tasks more efficiently and switch between them . Anyway great job guys 😉,positive
9196,"I hate change to begin with, but everything has been good SO FAR. My only gripe right now is with the themes! I wish we could custom pick a color or choose a photo from our phone gallery.",positive
9197,"The best to do app I've used by far. One tiny feature/design request : Can you please show the subtask count (total and completed) in the widget as well. Currently I need to click the task in the widget, which leads me to the task screen on app which shows the subtask count.",positive
9198,"Awesome upgrade from Wunderlist. I couldn't expect I can live without Wunderlist. I just give it a try and now I don't regret for it. Truly a great successor of wunderlist. But if u can,please make the font size Customization option. It will be really helpful",positive
9199,"I preferred Wunderlist. But in general this is working too. Please allow the user to set a default time for reminder suggestions. Currently it suggests for example 3am in the morning, not very useful.",positive
9200,Reminder doesn't work as per expectations. If we set any task with due date and if get completed before due date and try to mark it completed...that task get completed but new task get added with same name and same due date till that due date.,positive
9201,"The app worked better when it was Wunderlist. It often has problems syncing, which is inconvenient for shared lists. Overall the features are really nice though.",positive
9202,I love this app. It's easy to customise. Can you add a feature for a timer? That way people can measure how long they did a certain task for.,positive
9203,almost perfect but need time setting for due dates as most students using it will require to have proper time input of their assignments. cheers to the team! did a great job!,positive
9204,"Good replacement app for Wunderlist. Perhaps even better. I just got it a couple of weeks ago, so we shall see. It's easy to use and I like the look of it.",positive
9205,"I use this app everyday to track my errands and tasks. I wish it had more features like connection to email and phone. Even so, app is easy to use and keeps me organized.",positive
9206,Microsoft is like Wanderlist. Originally had issues sharing and syncing this To Do List app. Appears to be settling down. We like to it now.,positive
9207,"Would be good to have a ""Tomorrow"" list. So when in bed clearing mind at the end of the day, the default list, ""my day"" isn't cleared.",positive
9208,Like all the other users of Wunderlist i had no choice but to switch. It took time to figure out how to be able to create lists without having to have due dates & reminders-shut them off in settings. I already had a Microsoft account which I used to sign into Wunderlist so I used it to automatically sign into To Do. That made it easy to import the Wunderlist lists to To Do {pop up at bottom}. I panicked at first but I was able to figure out how to use To Do in about an hour after installing it,positive
9209,Nice design but...have been a happy wunderlist customer for a long time and the feature very important to me...being able to sort my list with a long press and slide up or down ...made it fast and easy to prioritize my day and make quick changes. The inbox was also a feature which was very important to me and gave me the confidence of not losing important info while on the fly. I realize that MiCrosoft To Do is NOT Wunderlist but hoping for these features to be restored,positive
9210,"We had some syncing issues with our shared lists that came in from Wunderlist, but once we had them syncing things have worked great!!!",positive
9211,"Moving from the wonderful wunderlist to To Do app was easy and now some other feature are added, among which I like ""Add to My Day"" and ""Tasks"".",positive
9212,The app is perfect but one tiny problem: the reload icon is sometimes peeking out at the bottom of the list title.,positive
9213,"Switch to 'to do' because wunderlist is being discontinued. It is a lovely app, easy to navigate interface. However, the function of 'today' smart list is not integrated. In wunderlist, this is the hat I was working from. It would be great to see 'today' smart list again! By the way, ""My day"" smart list doesn't automatically pick up the day's tasks, instead you have to add them. 🤷‍♀️",positive
9214,The widget sometimes shows my list as empty. And it always need to be removed and replace to show the content of the list properly.,positive
9215,Love this app Can guys add this features please 1. Task priority tag (red for important) 2. More notifications options ( sometimes a single clicking sound is not enough wish you add alarm settings) Thanks,positive
9216,It helped me a lot to stay ahead of my schedule. A productive app. But after some time some reminders don't work and I have to set them again.,positive
9217,Not as good as its old version wunderlist. Especially when you want to upload and download files through this app.,positive
9218,Missing one key feature: custom sorting of lists. Otherwise quite good. Search capability is excellent.,positive
9219,Great app! Simple and neat UI. It would however be nice if you could also include a passcode lock.,positive
9220,I migrated to this app a few months ago from Wunderlist which I absolutely loved! Im still getting used to this version and the Microsoft integration as I have been a GSuite user for a few years now. While I love this app I took one star for the MyDay list. I get the developers want you to be more intentional BUT I plan my day the night before so this list is useless to me. And with the due dates not auto loading in it also makes it difficult. Nice thought but does not work for night planners.,positive
9221,"Thus far, I'm finding To Do useful. It feels a step up from Wunderlist. Time will tell for sure.",positive
9222,"Great to do app, seemless integration with Windows. Would love to see the option to open the mobile app with the My Day tab already open.",positive
9223,"It's a good start, but I miss some of the simple capability of Wunderlist.",positive
9224,"One of the better cleaner to do apps Could you please add recurring tasks based on day or date. As an example: ""Recurring Every Wednesday : Take out trash"".",positive
9225,"This app is great, and I'm sticking to it. The only issue I have with it is the notification, it doesn't work when the app is closed. Please fix that.",positive
9226,Very nice app. Almost as good as Apple 😁. Would be nice if I could schedule task on calendar. But great that I can have on phone and laptop. Dumped other apps that do more for this simple straight forward app that allows me to capture stream of consciousness things I need to do like reschedule doctor apt. Got rid of paper tablet on my desk in favor of this.,positive
9227,I wish there was an option to create a to-do list for tomorrow. Like I wish there was a my tomorrow that would turn into my day instead of me having to manually add all the things I wrote the day before if that makes sense,positive
9228,Microsoft version of Wunderlist. Lists can be shared and sync'd between users. Needs drag and drop feature to allow items in lists to be prioritised based on position.,positive
9229,"Easy transition from Wunderlist, and it covers the vast majority of functionality.",positive
9230,"Very good. I love that flagged emails appear as tasks in this app. I would love an option to bring all of the day before's task to today in one go, instead of having to add them back to ""My Day"" one by one. I love the, ""Planned tasks"" feature, too, so I can see all of the tasks with due dates assigned to them. Lists can be added for different contexts, subjects and people. I would prefer a few more options than, ""Today"" , ""Tomorrow "" and next week. This is a great app.",positive
9231,"Finally an excellent personal workflow tool from Microsoft! To Do is a great tool for smartphones, syncing with Outlook tasks and flagged email to deliver a dedicated task management dashboard. The My Day feature promotes a GTD approach, but might be improved by sorting on a numbered list rather than simply on high or normal priority. Each task can have subtasks, but subtasks lack due dates, notifications, etc. Projects are not explicitly addressed but can be managed by adding task lists.",positive
9232,"I learned about the Wunderlist buyout. So I transferred over to MS To Do List. I love it & will surely miss my Wunderlist. MS To Do List is almost identical. I wasn't too afraid of the change. MS works great, but my biggest complaint is when you add something new to a list, it adds it to the bottom instead of the top. I didn't think it added it so I added it again & again. Then saw 3 same things on the bottom. I can sort based on date added, but it mixes up. Plz hurry the add to top option. Thx",positive
9233,"I have only had this app for a few days. The more I search for solutions the more I find. This is a great app, but it needs a way to give each task a sortable priority number. I love the My Day page which gives me the most important subset of all my tasks. I never put more than 5 things there. If I complete them before the end of the day, I add more. One of my favorite features is the ability to hide completed tasks. The biggest fault is I haven't found a tutorial for all the features.",positive
9234,Good replacement for Wunderlist. Missing the possibility to create to-do by sending email.,positive
9235,"So now that you're Microsoft, please expand basic features like + button to create a task from the main screen, I want to start recording my task PRIOR to selecting a list or any other options. Allow hard press on task to see options rather than having to go in each to make changes after creation. Provide 'separation' function so I can group items on the same list, no overly complicated group option required.",positive
9236,Great app. Only complaint is that I'd like the AMOLED dark mode in the app to match the widget.,positive
9237,"I tried out several to do apps to replace my sun-setting Wunderlist and liked this one the best. The only feature I'm missing at this point (and it is a big one, thus the 4 instead of 5 stars) is a list of all tasks/to dos. One master list of everything from all other lists is a crucial feature and very much needed! For now I am marking all tasks as important so they are all captured there as a workaround. P.s. I am loving the tags feature, and the audio when you check a task off. So fulfilling!",positive
9238,"Such a useful app. Never again will I miss reminders, or find it too much hassle to add a task. Would like to be able to change the default reminder time without having to amend every one, and would like to see support for tasks from non exchange accounts (e.g hotmail etc.) but even with these unavailable to me the app is still amazing. I thoroughly recommend this.",positive
9239,"I like it but sometimes does not response correctly, and need more options to do the daily use easier",positive
9240,"Please add a feature like task has to be divided based on categories inside ""planned"" and ""importent"" list",positive
9241,Give more features on par with Google Keep. Dark mode too is an essential tool that's sorely missing.,positive
9242,"I use it as an integral part of Office365 online services and especially the Outlook/One Note combination as a means of staying on top of tasks within longer term projects. I don't find it helpful for short term todo lists and I can't seem to ""program"" future tasks to show up in ""my day"". But I wouldn't want to be without it.",positive
9243,Some functionality is not seamless. There is no feature to order the tasks in a custom order or group tasks within a list,positive
9244,"I like having the choice of what to add to my To Day every morning. It gives me a chance to review and decide what is important today. One negative..when you check off a reaccuring task, the next scheduled one pops up. Every time I review the list my eye has to stop and check the little date to make sure it isn't a task for today.",positive
9245,"Looks like a good app. I've been using Wunderlist for many years. BUT, I miss a lot sending emails to To do list like I was used to in Wunderlist. I use this feature in Wunderlist and Evernote a cannot imagine living without it. Otherwise I would give 5*. Flagging in Outlook is not an option as I don't use Outlook.",positive
9246,"Good app overall but still doesn't recognise the date of reminder from plain text, this needs to Improve",positive
9247,Good app but a big improvement would be to have categories for a grocery shopping list. I add things as I run out but that is not how they are found in the store. I would like to group item by product type so I don't miss getting something or have to backtrack.,positive
9248,"Everything is good, only one feature shall be add. We should be able to customise Reminder Notification tone",positive
9249,Mostly works well as replacement for Wunderlist. Import worked well from Wunderlist. However I wish that you had a choice to automatically add new items at the top of the list instead of the bottom. You can sort by date added but then you lose your customized order of items.,positive
9250,Works well overall but recently won't add entry from widget on homescreen. It would be great if items from the Planned/Task categories with a due date would automatically be added to My Day on said due date rather than having to open the Planned/Task categories and adding to My Day from there. Just a thought!,positive
9251,"Still needs some work to get it up to par with Wunderlist, but works ok",positive
9252,Purely task management; not Google Keep Competitor. I'd switch today if I was able to create quick notes as well. OneNote is too rich in features and has too heavy of a UI navigation to be a valid alternative. It's not stepping on OneNote's if it were to have this added.,positive
9253,"It's a bit redundant when dealing with recurrent tasks, doesn't allow scheduling those recurrent tasks to specific times of the day or set an expiry date for the recurrence, but otherwise quite functional and useful.",positive
9254,Please add two factor authentication. I couldn't post my request through app because I don't have a Facebook account to log in.,positive
9255,"This is and exact representation of how a To Do app should be. I love the widget, from which i can add a new task without getting into the app. There is no clutter in the interface, everything can be accessed from one page.",positive
9256,I love the app. But the only thing I hate about this app is that 1) Does not have a start and end time for tasks. 2) Stop showing task for the next day. 3) Sort the tasks based on start time.(or reminder time.),positive
9257,"I am a Wunderlist native. I do like this move except for one simple thing (as if now), I wish items were added at the top instead of the bottom. I realize I can sort, but I put some lists in a specific order for a reason.",positive
9258,"Overall a decent Todo app. It does have some things or desperately needs. 1) why can't I see the event time in the list. I can see the day but not the time. 2) why can't I sort by time? Again, I can sort by date but I can't look at the list and see what's coming next",positive
9259,This is the best reminders app that I've come across (and I've tried a few). It falls short of 5 stars as there are some simple usability changes they could make which would make the experience a little bit better. It doesn't feel like many updates are being made though.,positive
9260,"I still really miss being able to synch important to-do's (i.e. exams) with my calendar app, as I believe Wunderlist was able to do. Besides that, I'm very happy with the ease of use and functionality of this app, helps me everyday.",positive
9261,"It very easy to use, but we should be able to merge tasks for all accounts in one location. Changing account from personal to work or school is really annoying. I once lost all my data when my school account became inactive!",positive
9262,"It is a pretty nice app. I really like it. But why don't you you make the ""delete completed tasks"" button? Is it something too difficult? If this function will not appear in the nearest updates I will change the app for sure.",positive
9263,Adding tasks from Widget fails. After last update when adding a task from Widget goes directly to TASKS LIST by default instedad of going to the list you are watching in the Widget. I prefered when the task was added to the list shown at the moment. Edited 2/2/2020: corrected.,positive
9264,Works as well as Wunderlist for the most part. For shared lists though I would like to be able to disable notifications. It can get annoying when you share a list for grocery items and each deletion is sending a notification.,positive
9265,"I'm a Wunderlist user for years. Generally this app is good, just lack 2 important features: (1) Weekly view that includes overdue tasks, (2) Mark overdue task date in red on widget.",positive
9266,"Very nice app. It would be helpful if it is integrated with outlook calender, or can be added to outlook calender, just like evernote and wunderlist are connected to it.",positive
9267,"Clean easy interface, connected to an Alexa skill allows listings to sync. The planning side of things I am still trying to daisy chain To Do, Alexa and Outlook so I get a mutable event horizon where I input by voice and have the Outlook toolset available.",positive
9268,"Widget improvement needed. If I'm in the 'Groceries' tab, when I add a task in the widget, it should add the task in the current tab 'Groceries'. Now it add tasks on the 'tasks' tab by default when it should add tasks to the current tab by default. The App is good, but needs improvements.",positive
9269,"Hey , i have an suggestions for your app ... i am calling it bug ...and i would be highly appreciated if u can fix it ... according to me the ticked task must get deleted by its own ... Else everything is ok and deserves a 4 star ... if u can fix it i will give it a 5 star rating...",positive
9270,"Great app for sharing lists. Having the iOS, Android and Windows options makes it easy for everyone to manage and view the shared lists. Wish it had location based reminder and built-in spell check then it would be 5*..",positive
9271,"In the ""important"" category add option ""sort by group and list name"". Do the same for the widget. It is possibol to have important things from different category so categorising it in ""important"" segment make's it cleaner and easyer to track.",positive
9272,"Great except for ""Flagged Email"" setting. I get a lot of spam messages that are flagged. Therefore, we should be able to select and/or exclude certain folders.",positive
9273,Would be 5 stars if the list sorting had more functionality (could sort by more than one criteria simultaneously) but apart from that it is a very user friendly and effective tool which I use multiple times per day.,positive
9274,"Very good app, similar to a very basic project management system you can move your tasks around so you can manage them better could have more functionality in that area not overboard you want to keep it simple but overall Excellence application",positive
9275,Great app except for one huge issue: you cannot customize the snooze time. You can only snooze up to an hour in specified increments. Fix this issue and the app would be nearly perfect.,positive
9276,"Switched to using this few weeks back after reading positive reviews as replacement for Wunderlist. Much better than Android equivalents, but ability to plan 'My tomorrow' would be really helpful as I like to plan evening before.",positive
9277,"It is easy to use. I am sure I have more to learn though. I just wish that the color coding would show on the home page. When I open one list I can see it's color, but not until I open it.",positive
9278,"Great app, just like Wunderlist and more. The only thing I am missing is the ability to arrange my important tasks in the order that I would like. Please add this!",positive
9279,on android - It still won't let me add tasks to top of list where the list actually opens,positive
9280,"Functionality is great, however after certain periods of time, the widget goes blank. I have to remove and re-apply widget in the home screen to get tasks to appear again.",positive
9281,"Very useful for making To Dos and not forgetting anything. It syncs perfectly across several platforms (web, IOS, Android) and also allows for easy sharing and collaboration of tasks.",positive
9282,"Very helpful and useful. I made use of the widget very often, but it stopped working and only started back to work when I uninstalled and then reinstalled the app. Otherwise, this is is a 5-star app.",positive
9283,"Didn't like it at first, too complicated (compared to your previous super- minimal Reminder applet, attached to Launcher). I like it now, especially since I know how most bits work.",positive
9284,I am using this Appa past few months & seems good to me.This apps helps me in organising my stuff..I love it☺,positive
9285,"I'm coming from Wunderlist and I feel quite comfortable with the feel of the app, except that I miss the main view of one selected list's tems. It'll be cool if you added an alternative to the home view",positive
9286,Great for organizing milestones and to do lists,positive
9287,Helpful. Not like Wunderlist which was the best todo I ever used. Please add a feature to show my repeated daily tasks in My Day section automatically without adding it manually.,positive
9288,Make life easier to keep track of everything,positive
9289,"It's wonderful but when i download it last time ,it doesn't sign in ,there is a big problem,i do not know what to do",positive
9290,"All the activities planned or unplanned for today should appear under ""My Day""...",positive
9291,Coming from good old Wunderlist and this one is definitely a noticeable refinement. One feature I'm missing from good old Wunderlist is the ability to manually order tasks (this comes handy at times). In addition it would make sense to create a default reminder on the date of the task if such date is defined. With this couple of additions it's an easy 5 stars for me.,positive
9292,"It's ok, I guess not much different than many other calendar apps, still getting used to it",positive
9293,Works well - just what I need.,positive
9294,It's great bud it doesn't have task category or labales,positive
9295,"Please update the sorting algorithm to sort by due date including the reminder time in the to-do so I can see in a day which to-do comes first on top of the list. And also pls make the Planned section sortable as it's only sorted alphabetically, I want to sort by due date including the to-do reminder time.",positive
9296,Easy to use,positive
9297,Need some more designs in app,positive
9298,"good except notifications also vibrate, and there's no way to disable vibrations for this app!",positive
9299,Organized App,positive
9300,Some functionality is not seamless. There is no feature to order the tasks in a custom order or group tasks within a list,positive
9301,Great app! Simple and neat UI. It would however be nice if you could also include a passcode lock.,positive
9302,Please fix the Note part. It always crash on my phone 😢,positive
9303,"The best to do app I've used by far. One tiny feature/design request : Can you please show the subtask count (total and completed) in the widget as well. Currently I need to click the task in the widget, which leads me to the task screen on app which shows the subtask count.",positive
9304,Reminder doesn't work as per expectations. If we set any task with due date and if get completed before due date and try to mark it completed...that task get completed but new task get added with same name and same due date till that due date.,positive
9305,Please add two factor authentication. I couldn't post my request through app because I don't have a Facebook account to log in.,positive
9306,"Moving from the wonderful wunderlist to To Do app was easy and now some other feature are added, among which I like ""Add to My Day"" and ""Tasks"".",positive
9307,Give more features on par with Google Keep. Dark mode too is an essential tool that's sorely missing.,positive
9308,"Really needs and undo button, gesture or shake to undo. It's hell of a problem to find accidentally completed tasks.",positive
9309,It is so good If thtere is alarm it will be better,positive
9310,"Good app, usefull.",positive
9311,Love this app Can guys add this features please 1. Task priority tag (red for important) 2. More notifications options ( sometimes a single clicking sound is not enough wish you add alarm settings) Thanks,positive
9312,"Please add a feature like task has to be divided based on categories inside ""planned"" and ""importent"" list",positive
9313,"Everything is good, only one feature shall be add. We should be able to customise Reminder Notification tone",positive
9314,I don't Like how the due date doesn't change for the next day.,positive
9315,almost perfect but need time setting for due dates as most students using it will require to have proper time input of their assignments. cheers to the team! did a great job!,positive
9316,Transfer was seamless from Wunderlist ( last appt) to To Do,positive
9317,"This app is great, and I'm sticking to it. The only issue I have with it is the notification, it doesn't work when the app is closed. Please fix that.",positive
9318,Works.,positive
9319,Helpful for planning.,positive
9320,"It's a good start, but I miss some of the simple capability of Wunderlist.",positive
9321,"I like it but sometimes does not response correctly, and need more options to do the daily use easier",positive
9322,"For those coming from Wunderlist: To transfer your data, log on to a computer (not a phone or tablet) to transfer your data if you're having transfer trouble. Seems similar to the glory that was Wunderlist. But still not as good.",positive
9323,Nice,positive
9324,"Good app overall but still doesn't recognise the date of reminder from plain text, this needs to Improve",positive
9325,Not as good as its old version wunderlist. Especially when you want to upload and download files through this app.,positive
9326,on android - It still won't let me add tasks to top of list where the list actually opens,positive
9327,"Pretty good app, lets you organize tasks by categories, prioritize based on due dates and set reminders for each specific task. However, sometimes, reminders fail to notify you in the specified time and come rather delayed.",positive
9328,حلو جدا,positive
9329,Could be better if the tasks overdue would automatically show in Today,positive
9330,"Very Nice App ... But who really needs to be reminded of and check off things we do all the time in daily life? If something is important next week or whenever, we normally remember it without fail - or we write it down. This App, while very nice indeed, typifies and feeds society's obsession with mobiles and tablets - and it renders people even more stupidly 'dependent' upon help - instead of what used to be 'common sense.' 🤔",positive
9331,"I would like to see tags (they are already in the app, but need a better implementation), filters and location-based notifications, please.",positive
9332,"Would be good to have a ""Tomorrow"" list. So when in bed clearing mind at the end of the day, the default list, ""my day"" isn't cleared.",positive
9333,"Very good... Excellent features. Especially for the subtask, the option to add step for achieving the task/subtask. Kindly add a calendar feature to get an overview of what is ahead. Also, some ready made quick reminders like a call, payment, email, a template for grocery, etc would add cheery to the cake",positive
9334,The widget sometimes shows my list as empty. And it always need to be removed and replace to show the content of the list properly.,positive
9335,Works well,positive
9336,Good,positive
9337,Easy to quickly find and use,positive
9338,"Easy transition from Wunderlist, and it covers the vast majority of functionality.",positive
9339,Motivating app Would love it if it had more functional tools,positive
9340,Best personal assistant app,positive
9341,"O app é bastante funcional e cumpre o prometido. Acho que seria interessante ter features que integrem serviços, como um calendário. Ou seja, agendamos uma tarefa e isso irá constar no calendário escolhido. Isso evita ter que abrir dois apps pra ver os afazeres do dia. Precisa de tema dark no modo web.",positive
9342,Please add two options : 1- tag or label in task and list 2- password to enter application Thanks for free,positive
9343,I love that I can break a task into steps. I didnt like that they moved the completed task button from the bottom of list to side menu. All in all it is a good tool and it has improved a lot since I started using it.,positive
9344,"Not quite Wunderlist but I'm pretty happy overall with how it works. One suggestion would be having a ""Tomorrow"" option similar to my day so you can add stuff to your ""My Day"" the night before.",positive
9345,Good but it an be better if we can add contact no. Also ..,positive
9346,Noice,positive
9347,Love this app! Didn't think I could find something as good as Wunderlist but this app is better! Just a couple of things would make it perfect. Option to change font size and option to add new items to top of list.,positive
9348,"The app worked better when it was Wunderlist. It often has problems syncing, which is inconvenient for shared lists. Overall the features are really nice though.",positive
9349,"Good replacement app for Wunderlist. Perhaps even better. I just got it a couple of weeks ago, so we shall see. It's easy to use and I like the look of it.",positive
9350,"We had some syncing issues with our shared lists that came in from Wunderlist, but once we had them syncing things have worked great!!!",positive
9351,Good app for daily planning.,positive
9352,I love this app. It's easy to customise. Can you add a feature for a timer? That way people can measure how long they did a certain task for.,positive
9353,"This is a nice app, it does what I needed to do and it's there when I need to use it.",positive
9354,It helped me a lot to stay ahead of my schedule. A productive app. But after some time some reminders don't work and I have to set them again.,positive
9355,"Still needs some work to get it up to par with Wunderlist, but works ok",positive
9356,Good,positive
9357,"Great for collaboration and communication, especially since we cant meet face to face",positive
9358,It's a great app almost providing everything you want for free not like other apps. I just wish if there was a timer beside each task you do such that you can spend tasks more efficiently and switch between them . Anyway great job guys 😉,positive
9359,Why this app sends me notifications 30 seconds late?,positive
9360,Good replacement for Wunderlist. Missing the possibility to create to-do by sending email.,positive
9361,"Sure could use a ""completed tasks"" tab. I hide my completed tasks in tabs as it just gets messy and when I wanna check what is done, I gotta manually untick the ""hide completed"" and then tick it again. I'd also appreciate if you could see when the task was completed. Overall a great multiplatform tool, been using it since I found it.",positive
9362,"I preferred Wunderlist. But in general this is working too. Please allow the user to set a default time for reminder suggestions. Currently it suggests for example 3am in the morning, not very useful.",positive
9363,It helped me to plan my day and also more productive,positive
9364,Great app. Only complaint is that I'd like the AMOLED dark mode in the app to match the widget.,positive
9365,I am using this Appa past few months & seems good to me.This apps helps me in organising my stuff..I love it☺,positive
9366,"One of the better cleaner to do apps Could you please add recurring tasks based on day or date. As an example: ""Recurring Every Wednesday : Take out trash"".",positive
9367,I came across from Wunderlist and it does everything I need it to do except for one really annoying feature - on Wunderlist when you added a new item you had the option for it to go to the top or bottom of the list. I always want my newest entries to go to the top (especially in very long lists) as they are the things I want to action first. Include a simple option to allow this and your app will do everything Wunderlist did and I will be a happy man!,positive
9368,"Good app, could be better",positive
9369,Useful. Integrated.,positive
9370,"Thus far, I'm finding To Do useful. It feels a step up from Wunderlist. Time will tell for sure.",positive
9371,"Very nice app. It would be helpful if it is integrated with outlook calender, or can be added to outlook calender, just like evernote and wunderlist are connected to it.",positive
9372,Good,positive
9373,Great for general use and getting better.,positive
9374,Microsoft version of Wunderlist. Lists can be shared and sync'd between users. Needs drag and drop feature to allow items in lists to be prioritised based on position.,positive
9375,"Great to do app, seemless integration with Windows. Would love to see the option to open the mobile app with the My Day tab already open.",positive
9376,Microsoft is like Wanderlist. Originally had issues sharing and syncing this To Do List app. Appears to be settling down. We like to it now.,positive
9377,I wish there was an option to create a to-do list for tomorrow. Like I wish there was a my tomorrow that would turn into my day instead of me having to manually add all the things I wrote the day before if that makes sense,positive
9378,Serves it's purpose.,positive
9379,"Awesome upgrade from Wunderlist. I couldn't expect I can live without Wunderlist. I just give it a try and now I don't regret for it. Truly a great successor of wunderlist. But if u can,please make the font size Customization option. It will be really helpful",positive
9380,Easy to use.,positive
9381,"I loved wunderlist. For the most part, I also like To Do and think they've done a good job transferring things over. One feature I do not like is that the Today list has to be made the day of. I like to make my ""today"" list the night before--makes it easier to plan and be prepared. When I do that now, I wake up in the AM and my list isn't visible.",positive
9382,Missing one key feature: custom sorting of lists. Otherwise quite good. Search capability is excellent.,positive
9383,"I hate change to begin with, but everything has been good SO FAR. My only gripe right now is with the themes! I wish we could custom pick a color or choose a photo from our phone gallery.",positive
9384,The app is perfect but one tiny problem: the reload icon is sometimes peeking out at the bottom of the list title.,positive
9385,I was using Wunderlist but this seems to be a great replacement. It integrates very well with Outlook 365 and the reminders are easy to manage. Would certainly recommend it for anyone looking to manage task lists.,positive
9386,"I use it everyday and completely love it. It is very simplistic to use and understand, even for older folks like me! If I'm putting together a list of projects I want to get done; it's allows me to take a picture or a screenshot, then title and save it by Category! Extremely helpful for users of all age groups; and with the Backup & Sync features you just can't go wrong with this app!",positive
9387,I love making lists and this application makes it much more accessible to do so... 🟢I don't have to worry about which pocket my hand written list was last put into. 🟢I don't have to worry about keeping a pen on me or losing it in the store for the tenth time. Lol 😜 🟢AND I dont have to check things off!!!! The app just checks it off for me with a single tap.,positive
9388,"As always MS makes the best thing, but fails to offer video training and integration and some basic CRM features. Needs imporvement on 1) multi importance/priority level with drop down box and for sorting.... 2) ""Repeat"" doesn't add today's to-dos, just an alert. ... 3) Beable to organize more than just today....add wk mo & yr. .. 4) CRM and Calendar need upgrading and integration with Outlook app..... 5) Training??",positive
9389,"I was skeptical at first, but wow! Yes, the req to have a Microsoft account didn't thrill me, but this has all the features Wunderlist did and more - you just need to find them. You CAN move the order of tasks manually - just do an extra long tap on the task and drag. There is also a an inbox - here it is just called ""tasks"". This app is much more flexible in terms of themes than Wunderlist was and it makes it really easy to both delete tasks and steps within a task. Switching was easy too!",positive
9390,"Started using it after having used many To-Do apps. The UI is beautiful. Syncing is quite fast. The companion apps are available for every major operating system plus it is also available on the web, which is a big advantage over Google Tasks. However, I'd love to have natural language processing and a way to prioritise the tasks.",positive
9391,"I LOVE IT! This app us so simple and easy to use, it's so clear to see what needs to be done. I love how you can carry tasks over from one day to another or carry over tasks from over lists. I also love how you can add steps to a task and set a due date. I LOVE IT :)",positive
9392,"This is quite frankly the best to-do app I've ever used. It has features I didn't even know I needed, like searching for tasks, or the my day tasks list. It syncs really well and worked even better than I'd hoped. Great Job.",positive
9393,"Amazing simple effective. It would be nice that if it had a option that could set priority . For examplr priority 1 , 2 , 3. 1 with color red 2 with color orange and 3 with yellow. Like todoist app. I love miceosoft todo becuase its cross platform and 100percent free",positive
9394,Extremely well design! This is an amazing tool for the people who needs a good way to keep track of all your tasks in a day. Super helpful and very well integrated with Office 365 layout. This has boosted my progress tremendously. Thank you @Microsoft Office 365 Team.,positive
9395,"This app is very useful. Minimalist, yet almost everything is available. I could group my activities sub-activities and tasks as per my wish and use them to plan accordingly. A calendar option would make it complete.",positive
9396,The user interface of this app is high level and the way in which I can see my task is awesome but I think there must be some options in which I could be able to make quick notes of those although there is that option but it must be enhanced so that the user interface would be augmented,positive
9397,"Suggestion: . In my one of task, Status of the task, progressing stage is very important to us. So please to add the feature in it. Example, 60% Completed in Task. (Manually user mention or drag the Percentage bar in his task) It will be useful to us. Thank you To Do Team..",positive
9398,"I have tried a lot of to do App's but not a single one has all these features In built reminders sub Tasks support customizable moving of tasks in the list and most important sync across all devices like phone, tablet etc Even if some app has we have to buy premium to enjoy those features Highly recommend this app.",positive
9399,"I have found it's useful for you who want to manage your works or studies. Now I don't need to write all down on the papers. So, a solution to save papers = save our trees ;) More important, this app is free and no ads banners. That's good.",positive
9400,"I don't know why everyone's complaining that you can't re-order tasks and lists. Drag-and-drop with a long press works just fine for me. At first glance, I seem to have FINALLY found a suitable replacement for GTasks.",positive
9401,The app is splendid i love. It helps me to plane my day and my work ahead of time and reminds me of what i had planned to do. This makes me to be effective in my life. I can easily access my to do list where ever i go,positive
9402,This app is awesome. At the moment while we're in quarantine. I have to do a whole bunch of school work and it's just easier for me to make sure I'm doing everything. Make sure I'm getting everything done and it's just really great. Thank you so much!,positive
9403,"It's such a helpful app because I always use this so that I can become more productive and finish what I have to do on time, it's also helpful because it helps me remember what I have to do.😃😃😃",positive
9404,The best to-do app ever. It is so well synced with the desktop version and vice versa. The UI is awesome and smooth. It really feels good to use this app.,positive
9405,"Great app. I suggest that you will add a calendar view feature, sychronized with the created tasks, so that users can visualize their tasks. Thanks in advance.",positive
9406,Realizing Wunderlist was going away was unfortunate but this app does a great job at replacing it. I really like the graphics and the background image of the needle.,positive
9407,"Really very very great, useful and highly customised app. Above all it's free and developed by the World leader in customisation. Developer is so helpful to provide individual attention. HAPPY TO HAVE THIS GREAT APP.",positive
9408,"Excellent app, really useful for writing down what you have to do! It lets you manage your to-dos in convenient groups, and the feature ""My day"" is awesome for planning your day ahead",positive
9409,"Excellent - This is even better than Wunderlist which I really loved, they've taken it up another level. Brilliant cross platform tool for managing all my tasks",positive
9410,"I'm migrated user from wunderlist. Hasn't found any issue with this app I use this from mobile and pc's browser, I can say that the sync is fast, very like it",positive
9411,What a great app! It has completely made my days more productive and organized. Thank you so much Microsoft! I can't wait to see it linked to OneNote 😊,positive
9412,Brilliant app. All you need to keep on top of things. One thing I would add: the ability to delete bulk tasks.,positive
9413,"The best to do list app I've used to date. I'd used a lot before without any luck, I'm glad to say I don't think I'll be looking for any other apps now!",positive
9414,Super easy to use and very addictive. Strongly recommend to anyone looking for a uncomplicated and easy tinuse to-do app.,positive
9415,"Works much better than the desktop version, as it doesn't close itself suddenly when you're not on it!",positive
9416,"Exactly like Wunderlist where I came from, because that's being discontinued. Happy I have a viable replacement but sad to see Wunderlist go.",positive
9417,"Even for me that I have Android 5 in my phone is totally full option and useful. Dark theme and many necessary optional things make it best ""to do list"" ever!",positive
9418,Phew the transition from Wunderlist went just fine. Everything is imported and after a bit of tweaking in the settings the app works like Wunderlist did. And the app icon is easy to find.,positive
9419,This is a good app for note and everything as you want.... I am so happy for using this app....but it is more better if have search options...so currently improve it..,positive
9420,I've been really enjoying this app. The My Day feature is really useful for managing my tasks and Its so easy to just add new tasks as I get them. I especially love that you can add tasks from the previous day to your current My Day. It has a simple and streamlined design and seamlessly integrates my phones theme. The only thing I would improve would be the ability to add tasks to My Day in advance.,positive
9421,It's different from Wunderlist but pretty close. Its like changing from Gmail to outlook but it's working for me.,positive
9422,"The application is great! The UI is clean, easy to follow. It does exactly what it is intended to do. I have one suggestion. Alongside the possibility to add steps to the tasks, it would be great to be able to arbitrarily set the level of completion of one task with something like a slider. Say for example you set yourself the goal to watch a full youtube playlist. Everyday you move this task to ""My day"". You will want to be able to measure your progress each day without predefined steps.",positive
9423,"Useful, fast, and complete with all the essential features of a todo app.",positive
9424,I was a very big fan of Wunderlist and this replacement has a lot more functionality and is still easy to use,positive
9425,This is a very cool app. Perfect! Although it should have more link options for other apps as well.,positive
9426,Being able to sync shopping lists between various shoppers in one household is such a blessing. Keeps us from overspending. 😊,positive
9427,Just swapped from Wunderlist to Microsoft To Do. So far happy with it and not really noticing any difference or loss of functionality.,positive
9428,"Just moved from Wunderlist. Transition was easy. To Do is different in layout, but also intuitive & works fine on many platforms. I wish they have 2 things fixed/updated to meet Wunderlist feel: 1) Importance mark (the renown star) should be entered while typing a task. Importance mark should also put automatically the task on top of the list. 2) 'Show completed tasks' must be more 'handy', with a button, symbol or shortcut. Not as part of the menu (top right). 5 stars. Hope above of a help.",positive
9429,"It's an amazing app, i love it and find it extremely useful. Just discovered it recently and totally enjoying the productivity it gives me. I very much like the simplicity compared to other To-Do apps with too cluttered UI. Miscoroft ToDo on the other hand is perfectly balanced! One small thing i would personally want to see is the ability to assign more levels of priority, not just 'Important' and the rest. There could be importance levels like 'A', 'B', 'C' etc, or some color-coding, for example. Thanks and keep up the great work!!!!!! Microsoft on Android is doing a great job!",positive
9430,"Awesome app. Allows for custom lists and allows collaboration on ones you specifiy for group projects/tasks. The interface is clean, crisp, but also allows you to make it your own by adding color themes to the accents of the task pages. The only thing I wish this would include is a customizable ""smart list"" based on certain parameters. This would make the app even better, though out of the box - this has everything you need to get your tasks and projects done!",positive
9431,I've tried many to do list apps and this one is the best so far and is helping me with getting more productive with life and school work.,positive
9432,"This app is as good as Trello and almost works the same with some minor differences. I love it. It would be great if it combined the features of Trello Boards as well as Evernote. Still givin deserves 5 stars on its own merits. It can get overwhelming the more items that are put into it, but that's my own problem of having so much to do more than the app. This is the best automated To Do list I have found. I use it in combination with my handwritten lists.",positive
9433,"I came from Wunderlist as I got an email said it was shutting down on March 6th. I was expecting a sub par experience, having to re-enter all of my tasks and data. I was very surprised as it was a great switch over experience with very little input from me! It also has a very similar widget which im very happy with! Thank you for considering Wunderlist users!",positive
9434,"This app is just excellent! A truly powerful task and project manager. Don't be filled by its apparent simplicity - there are a lot of features and flexibility hidden in this little gem. Try it out! What I would like added though is if the My Day planning feature can be extended so I can plan for the next day, not only the same day, so I can populate my following day's My Day view in the evening before going to bed, instead of having to wait to plan on the morning only.",positive
9435,"Still a great app though coming from wunderlist I don't understand the crappy import. In wunderlist you add new tasks at the top of the list. In todo at the bottom. Yet it imports the list as if it was wunderlist. So all your lists will get new items added in todo at the bottom, where you had your oldest entries in wunderlist. All lists are basically inverted.",positive
9436,"Best to do app 1. You don't have to pay for the main things There no things to buy already 2. It is simple 3. Design is fantastic 4. They have main things of any todo app (List ,hashtags ,reminders, my day tasks , important task , due date ,....) Okay , there are features in another todo app you won't find it here like ""sub-sub tasks"" But another app you have to buy another nesscery feature like reminder ... So I suggest this app ""microsoft to do"" is the best to do app💙💙",positive
9437,"When Microsoft announced they were killing Wunderlist, my expectations for the New Thing were soooo low. But they did a great job! It has all the familiar featues plus some new ones like subtasks, and the user experience is pretty solid! Importing was easy. Great job! The one negative is Microsoft's strongheaded wrong assumption that everyone wants ""one Microsoft account for everything."" Please preserve the ability to create different accounts for different purposes!",positive
9438,Helps me remember things and keep them organized. It can really work cross devices - hassle free!,positive
9439,"Wonderfully app, I have a suggestion to add Sticky in this app instead of Office, or make a Spreat Sticky App Sync with Microsoft Windows",positive
9440,I was mortified when I heard Wunderlist was going to be withdrawn. I downloaded this as suggested and I am pleased with it. It is much the same with a few little extras. Easy to use and well organised without a lot of extra clutter that other apps give you. I have decided to use this app immediately instead of waiting until Wunderlist ends.,positive
9441,"I've tested several tasks apps and this is my favourite. Super simple though effective! The views are just great. Plan by project and execute by due date. Overwhelmed? Add to My Day just what you feel you can accomplish. I would just suggest a ""delete done tasks"" button, because though you can already hide them the list can become quite big if you use, as I do, recurring daily tasks.",positive
9442,"Awesome to do list, makes things like grocerie lists very simple the way list can be compiled as a page of single swipeable tabs.",positive
9443,THE BEST TO DO APP EVER! Now I don't forget any important things on my mind. I can write or record at anytime or anywhere. Thanks MS,positive
9444,"I Love this app. It helps me stay organized and reminds me about every single task I have. The UI is great, and integration with Outlook (flagged emails) and windows is exceptional I'd also love the idea option to 'review my day' to know exactly how much I got done; and integration with Outlook's calenders - that would be nice... Microsoft has some amazing apps and getting to use them all ends up feeling natural... Hats off to the developers",positive
9445,"I use To Do to track my college assignments and projects. I had tried several other systems but none had the organizational power of To Do. I love that I can have a list for each class and attach a due date to each assignment it. The built-in Planned list pulls all assignments from my different classes into one list and sorts them by due date. I'm also planning to start using it for my Getting Things Done system (David Allen), which I currently have in Evernote. It's a huge win for me!!",positive
9446,"""Microsoft To Do"" keeps my wife and I on the same page! We use it, increasingly, to help us plan and track routine tasks or specific projects around the house, through shared lists! Because ""Microsoft To Do"" lets you create customizable list, it can be adapted to almost any purpose or project; more specifically we share a, grocery/shopping list, chore list, meal planning list (including ingredients/recipe), a travel checklist, and a gift tracking lists. The ""attach file"" option is a big bonus!",positive
9447,Great app. I like it just make a better looking widget and allow us to connect to samsung calendar,positive
9448,This is a great organizational tool. It literally combines all my relevant tasks in one place.,positive
9449,"Love this simple app. It works well..apart from the odd inconsequential blip. It has helped me to organise my day, list all my to-dos so they're not in my head. It's simple enough to learn how to use quickly and I've got my daily schedule on repeat so regular events pop up daily, weekly, monthly or as one off dates.",positive
9450,"Easy to use and access. Helpful reminder, especially on busy days.",positive
9451,Using this app is a great way to organize assignments/ daily tasks/ appointments/ to-do lists. You can keep track of what is due and what has been completed. I use it to keep track of assignments for all of my classes and it's so easily accessible and user-friendly. This app has helped me break my terrible habit of procrastinating. I actually look forward to doing my homework just so that I can check off all the tasks on my list 😋,positive
9452,"I find this an excellent to-do app with sharing capabilities. I love how there is even an option to have completed tasks ""crossed off"" or disappear altogether from a list. I find myself turning up the volume to hear that sweet bell tune when a task is completed, lol.",positive
9453,"Very competent App. I have actually migrated from Todoist after 3 years. Why? Because I piled everything into Todoist because of its wide functionality but couldn't see wood for the trees. Any one item could be a project header, a complicated task or a trivial one off task. I have now reverted to managing projects in appropriate software (in my case mindmanager with a task export to outlook and synch to ToDo ) and tasks in the very neat and focused ToDo app which grows on you as you use it.",positive
9454,The task list is so easy to use and it synchs my phone to my laptop.,positive
9455,Easy to use. For quick list with reminders for daily or last minute reminders.,positive
9456,"Overall fine, Search option only on main screen, pl give it inside Task list, user list also, also data export option",positive
9457,"Recently replaced Wunderlist with this app, after getting used to it I have to say I prefer this app. I like that once you pick a sorting sequence for each category it automatically carries out this function when you add a further entry ie due date. I would have preferred that a folder for completed tasks etc was retained but other than that I'm happy with this app.",positive
9458,"A little gem of an App. It is simple to use yet offers plenty of options for getting yourself organised and for list management. I find the 4 level hierarchy so useful. The hierarchies are Groups > Lists > Tasks > Steps but you can leave out level 1 if a particular list is not part of a group. I also like the fact that ""My Day"" is managed manually as this ensures that I actually bother to review it. Integration with Office 365 makes your plan available on all your devices and gives you a backup.",positive
9459,Simple. Best and optimum. The best to do list notifier and noting app.,positive
9460,Great task app. Still don't know how to integrate in to outlook on pc. Wunderlist had integration,positive
9461,"Though it started bland sometime ago, To-Do is getting better and better. I find myself using it more and more as it is very convenient for me in my Microsoft Ecosystem. Developers are also responding well for user feedback and ideas for improvements.",positive
9462,Really great for staying organized! Super easy to use.,positive
9463,Loved how everything is that u offer now. And loved the themes backgrounds and also that u can change the colors. I love pink I changed it to that. I will recommend this apo to other's. Hope u stay forever. This is the best app of the to do ever. And the only one I use. And will ever use.,positive
9464,"Great app, very useful for both personal and work reminders.",positive
9465,"Outstanding app. It's difficult to suggest any features I would add as it has everything I need. The more I use it, the more uses and features I find. If there were more stars, I would rate it higher. Update: one feature I would add is a static ""completed"" folder.",positive
9466,"I absolutely love this app. I am a sorter at heart, so being able to divide my list into the different sections of my life is very helpful. I also LOVE that I can add others people to my lists. This helps me keep everyone on the same page. Thank you Microsoft for helping me organize my life.",positive
9467,Super easy to use. Amazing interface. Great for anyone who likes to stay organized,positive
9468,Because it lists everything in alphabetical order it is now the perfect app. Thank you microsoft.,positive
9469,"Such a great app for reminders etc. All the functionality and features I would like to have seen in the now redundant Cortana for Android are in this app. Nice UI, great features and a pleasure to use. Would like to see integration with calender and a feature to add travel such as flights etc but in the meantime still an excellent app.",positive
9470,"Keeps everything organized between my wife and me. Now she can even tell me what to do when im not home. Really though, keeps us totally coordinated and stops us wasting time. Live ut for my own lists too. I live by lists so this is a dream come true.",positive

9474,Great app easy to use and keeps us all in sync with our tasks at work,positive

9479,Easy to use and cross platform synching makes this app one of the best for managing to do activities,positive
9480,"Really awesome app, it helps my team and I go through all our important chores on the date and time we need it. The notifications about changes and new chores also really helps because you know exactly when something changes.",positive
9481,"Simply the most delightful app I worked with for my tasks. It's minimal, but it has a wide range of features, specially how we can repeat a task anyway we want. That's exactly what I was looking for.",positive
9482,Very exciting app. Very helpful for my daily or weekly shedule. 🌟🌟🌟🌟👍👍👍👍,positive
9483,"Best Todo app I've used ever. I love the concept of starting each day afresh, makes me feel like I'm actually accomplishing something unlike when you see the same task on your list day after day after day.",positive
9484,"Great list organizer! I've used any.do for several years, and frankly I like the organization and features of Microsoft To Do better. The only feature I miss is a total task count. Microsoft will likely add it in time.",positive
9485,Works a treat! Especially useful for planning what I need to do on a daily basis.,positive
9486,"Best to do app I have found so far. MS doesn't always get it right, but they hit it out of the park with this one!",positive
9487,Easy to use and has all basic functions required,positive

9489,I got this app to write my schedule on it. it works great!! my children liked it too!!,positive
9490,"The original app (WunderList) was a bit better, but this one still does the job. It's particularly interesting for unorganized households.",positive
9491,"Easy to use and neat interface, great supplement to sort your days out, also a great reminder replacement (for the long dead Cortana)",positive

9501,A fantastic way of sharing tasks with the family and Alexa.,positive
9502,"I really like this app. Even when you are retired one needs some order to keep balance in one life. I have learned to appreciate its benefits: tasks (the little things we seem to forget every day), shopping lists, reminders and the themes that makes it fun. 👍👍",positive
9503,"If you can customize the colur of the title of the list (the name that you see in the bar) it would be a nice feature, other than that great app",positive
9504,Was sad to replace Wunderlist but this app is really good. I particularly like the My day feature and the fact you can see all your To dos for today all together.,positive
9505,Love it,positive
9506,"After trying a few other apps, I decided to us this one. The things that attracted me were very easy to use and have all the features I needed.",positive

9508,Amazing,positive
9509,Great for organising my work life balance,positive
9510,"I absolutely love this app! It looks amazing, the dark theme is a great addition. It's also really cool to be able to make lists within lists. 5 out of 5",positive

9531,I love making lists and this application makes it much more accessible to do so... 🟢I don't have to worry about which pocket my hand written list was last put into. 🟢I don't have to worry about keeping a pen on me or losing it in the store for the tenth time. Lol 😜 🟢AND I dont have to check things off!!!! The app just checks it off for me with a single tap.,positive
9532,"As always MS makes the best thing, but fails to offer video training and integration and some basic CRM features. Needs imporvement on 1) multi importance/priority level with drop down box and for sorting.... 2) ""Repeat"" doesn't add today's to-dos, just an alert. ... 3) Beable to organize more than just today....add wk mo & yr. .. 4) CRM and Calendar need upgrading and integration with Outlook app..... 5) Training??",positive
9533,Realizing Wunderlist was going away was unfortunate but this app does a great job at replacing it. I really like the graphics and the background image of the needle.,positive

9536,Wow Too Good,positive
9537,It's different from Wunderlist but pretty close. Its like changing from Gmail to outlook but it's working for me.,positive
9538,"Sencilla, práctica, y cumple como debería. Si buscás una app para anotar tareas o recordatorios está es la indicada. Lo mejor es que puedes tener la app tanto en celular como en ordenador y lo que anotas en uno se actualiza en el otro.",positive
9539,Very useful,positive
9540,This app is awesome. At the moment while we're in quarantine. I have to do a whole bunch of school work and it's just easier for me to make sure I'm doing everything. Make sure I'm getting everything done and it's just really great. Thank you so much!,positive
9541,Best to do list app so far. I like it,positive

9544,This is a good app for note and everything as you want.... I am so happy for using this app....but it is more better if have search options...so currently improve it..,positive
9545,This is a very cool app. Perfect! Although it should have more link options for other apps as well.,positive
9546,Very useful.,positive
9547,It's top notch! But I removed it just because other outlook-related apps not working well in outlook,positive
9548,"I use it everyday and completely love it. It is very simplistic to use and understand, even for older folks like me! If I'm putting together a list of projects I want to get done; it's allows me to take a picture or a screenshot, then title and save it by Category! Extremely helpful for users of all age groups; and with the Backup & Sync features you just can't go wrong with this app!",positive

9551,You rock! From Grumpy Grandma. Than you SO MUCH!,positive
9552,"I LOVE IT! This app us so simple and easy to use, it's so clear to see what needs to be done. I love how you can carry tasks over from one day to another or carry over tasks from over lists. I also love how you can add steps to a task and set a due date. I LOVE IT :)",positive

9572,Great app,positive
9573,Best app for daily life.,positive
9574,Very easy to use.,positive
9575,"This app is very useful. Minimalist, yet almost everything is available. I could group my activities sub-activities and tasks as per my wish and use them to plan accordingly. A calendar option would make it complete.",positive
9576,Amazing app to take notes and make to do lists.,positive
9577,"This is quite frankly the best to-do app I've ever used. It has features I didn't even know I needed, like searching for tasks, or the my day tasks list. It syncs really well and worked even better than I'd hoped. Great Job.",positive
9578,Better than previous app I used,positive
9579,Super awesome 👍,positive
9580,Very useful,positive
9581,Works great,positive

9583,Great!!,positive

9585,Very useful,positive
9586,Not what I thought it was... This only blocks out time for your calendars. I was looking for something that would help with daily routines. 😕. I even tried to use the calendar before giving up... But it refused to sync. So it's useless,negative
9587,"dependant on another calendar app. Why? why do I need to have another app to use this app? I can't add plans or schedule without this app throwing the task to Google Calendar. Besides, I don't use G.C anymore since I once missed an event which I put a reminder through the G.C app because it never reminded me. I read one comment for this app that it never gave a reminder for a scheduled task and yes I have an idea why it happened.",negative
9588,"Doesnt work on ALL android Wear OS devices. Specifically, doesnt work with the Watch Active2.",negative
9589,"Too complicated. It probably has a lot of, but it's not intuitive enough.",negative
9590,"cool visual but doesn't work the way I thought it would. I don't like organizing my hour-by-hour tasks through my calendar because it clutters it up and makes me miss my important events. I wanted to use this app thinking that it would allow me to plan my dialy tasks just through the app. But every time I want to plan an event it forces me to do it through my calendar which I don't like. good concept, but I don't see a reason to use it since it just wants me to use my calendar anyway.",negative
9591,"I wanted to like it, iinitially it looked great but it has such a limited window of time view it's no good for planning. A few hours view and that's it. Scrolling hour by hour day by day? Useless. Its sole function appears to be to tell you what you've got coming up in the next few hours which frankly is not much use to anyone as far as I can see. Cloud Cal uses similar circles with a view of the whole month which would be great but sadly the pro version doesn't work so no go there either.",negative
9592,"Used to love it, but the latest version broke it. Couldn't get it to work. All widget face buttons would work for a few seconds then break. Tried all settings, didn't work. Fix it and I'll reconsider my rating.",negative
9593,There should be add different time schedule in app not be in mobile colander,negative
9594,Puts all info in default Google calendar.,negative
9595,"It has a lot of functionality bugs. Some of my events were not adding, after restaring the app, other events just disappeared etc. I m really sorry i had to delete it because it looked nice and could be very useful but it s not working. Thanks!",negative
9596,"I like this app. It's just that whenever I enter something in my calendar, it would not sink right away.",negative
9597,"does not work properly , does not update wit hcalendar entries , worst thing , cannot aak my money back!!!!!!!",negative
9598,Cannot use without existing calendar,negative
9599,Clicking on the widget doesn't open the app anymore :( :(,negative
9600,"Won't sync with my Calendar, Sam-Note 10",negative
9601,Not sync with Google Calendar,negative
9602,"Uninstalled...Not at all what I thought it was. This entire app is basically just a fancy way to look at the calendars you already have. Everything syncs both ways, so if you add your actually daily schedule minute by minute to this app you are also cluttering up your calendar(s) with the same things. Would've been neat if it actually had some kind of function, but I don't need to waste sd card space on a calendar viewing app.",negative
9603,"How it SHOULD work is fantastic and perfect for me. But whenever I have my schedule laid out and planned, the app deletes them or forgets them and i have to start over, only to have them deleted again. I really really want to use it. Why does it make it so unable to?",negative
9604,It gives the option to add a local calendar but doesn't let you use it unless you also give permission to use a Google or Outlook calendar. Kind of defeats the purpose of doing a local-only calendar if I can't actually use it.,negative
9605,"Good on paper, tried it out and off the bat wouldn't sync any news items, wish it had an option to at least input items directly. Either way didnt work",negative
9606,"Dude. Don't we all want people to pay us for everything we come up with. XXXXXXX Hi! Thanks for the attentive reply. Though this app was not worth the payment or storage space for me, I did find one that works nicely. Looking forward to more replies, hopefully relevant, or none at all.",negative
9607,"Most of My Google calendar events doesn't appear in the sectograph app. If i try to delete some events which is appeared, it cannot remove in the app also. I prefer if the app has own calendar so that events that ill creat might able show easier.",negative
9608,Edit: Still doesn't work. I suggest adding proper integration with Outlook because it is leaps and bounds ahead of Google in terms of usability and ease. - Before Edit: Doesn't show me the events already listed on my Outlook calendar. Every day is blank. When I go to add an event with only Outlook calendar selected it wants me to add an event into another calendar. I don't care about adding events (I can do it on another platform) but if can't even see my Outlook events then this is useless. Gave it all necessary permissions and checked dates and synced.,negative
9609,"The idea is great, however it adds only event to my calendar. I like circle planer idea and that I simply can put work and then event at work and that it reflects on this circle. This has potential but make it simple and functional. I was used to test some apps and for me this was not functional and easy going. Make it that 7 years old kid can use it.",negative
9610,Love this app. Got the pro version. It will save a lot of my cognitive work! Please fix this bug: The colour of events are set to blue when the event is created using the default colour of the (sub) calendar. Overall the app needs better UX design w.r.t the complex menu for customization and some other things e.g it was hard to figure out how to get separate widget for different calendars. But in terms of functionality it is awesome!,negative
9611,"What appealed to me the most about this app was the promise that we get to see the clock on your home screen. However the settings doesn't offer that option... Now it's just another app callendar you have to tap to see what's coming up... I liked the idea I could just turn on my phone and bang! the clock would just simply show me my schedule... Idk if it's a bug or just a false promise, either way it's disappointing.",negative
9612,"Purchased the full version which did nothing. Opted for a 24 hour face, again nothing. Tried to add additional events in upcoming days, did not show up at all.",negative
9613,Bought the Paid version. The app fails to get data from anything except Gmail. Good concept but lacks in across provider connectivity.,negative
9614,"I wanted to like this app. It's a very convenient way to see all the info I need right on the screen, but when I click on the task button I get trapped on the task screen with no way back. I have to kill the app to restart it in the clock visualization mode.",negative
9615,"Does not integrate month calendar view and 24hrs view within the circular widget graphics: it only shows 24hrs (12hrs in free version). Very restrictive: the widget shows full info for one day, and no info ahead, unless you select a different day. For the days ahead you need to leave the widget, and work in a different environment. Why complicate your life? Find a calendar app you like, stay with it, come back to Sectograph when (and if) the widget fully implements time and task management.",negative
9616,"Poor settings options. I tried to set a schedule for an entire day to be more productive. Kept getting emails for each task at the time I scheduled it. I also got notification pop-ups on my MacBook calendar app which seemed to sync itself with my Google calendar. I went to Google calendar to turn it off but it wouldn't let me. I had to delete all 10 emails, hide the notifications and now I will be uninstall this app. It should have an option to disable syncing. Nice idea. Lazy developers.",negative
9617,"After installing the app, i check to see if my reacurring event would show up. And it did that one time. So minutes after i insalled i had to let it go.",negative
9618,"Great Concept but executed poorly. I added 2 events between 6.30am and 9.30 but when I tried adding one for 10.30am it would let me, saying it overlapped with another event which it did not. I even checked my calendar and nothing was there for that time. It's now 11.42am, I tried adding an event for 3.30pm and it said its saved but hasn't showed on the clock or anything so it's pretty useless at this point.",negative
9619,Worked fab until recently then I noticed the time in the centre was an hour wrong although when I went into the app it had the time right. So I uninstalled and tried to reinstall but when I tried to put the widget on my home screen it now puts on a blank box that's resizable but invisible otherwise! Very disappointed.,negative
9620,"It's pure discriminating to have to BUY an extension to be able to use 24-hour mode! Either make it free or let EVERYONE pay for the app! I would love to try this app because it really looks like it has a really nice concept, but since the devs choose to make just SOME people pay for it, then I'll gladly give it a bad review instead..",negative
9621,I don't know why I can't seem to be able to adjust the hours correctly. when I updated the time to wake up at 7.30 am but the app keep displaying I'm to wake up at 6.30am...what's wrong? wasted my time keep trying to update it. This is good effort for developer to create this app but can pls fix all the issue...may seem minor but to me it's confusing and thus rendering it less useful. tq.,negative
9622,"BESTApp ever super useful the only reason for the bad review, is because I already paid for the pro-version of this app because it's that useful*!!..BUT it's very disappointing This app is not supported by my Google watch its not compatible with my Ax Armani connected smart watch please fix ; it would be very useful to see my appointments and errands displayed on my watch. without having to open my phone to view than thanks alot I'll removed the bad feed back onces its fixed- 5 stars!",negative
9623,So it's just a demo to see if you would like to purchase the app. It says it does this so you can learn how to use the app. BUT it doesn't allow you to do anything because none of my info or calenders can be added to it because it's just a demo. So it's really hard to tell if I like something if I can't do anything on it. Something to think about if you actually want to make money selling an app. Just saying. Thanks for wasting my time while I'm trying to save time.,negative
9624,Only certain Google calendar entries show in the sectograph making this absolutely pointless. A great idea that is flawed in execution.,negative
9625,Uninstalled as calendar events keep appearing under the wrong date. Disappointing.,negative
9626,"it shows you all the features, very helpful and everything and as a final blow... it will tell you that 24 hour widget is only available via in app purchase. This is very very misleading for someone who have given their time, signed in with google, synced their events etc. frustrated.",negative
9627,"Nothing work, I have my calendar prepared for months, and nothing come inside the Sectograph, Even I added new one, nothing appeared",negative
9628,"This program does not work, PERIOD! Installed. Opened. Just sits there at the start screen, frozen and does nothing. No available controls or menu. Nothing. Do not use it. There is nothing to use.",negative
9629,Inaccurate - always says activity overlaps with another activity when it doesn't.,negative
9630,"Not sure how this app received such high ratings. It is just making you add events in your Google calendar to create a pie. I don't want to add daily tasks to my Google calendar. I thought this app was going to be more efficient, but it's not.",negative
9631,I wasted my time and money because it doesn't sync to my watch. I spent hours trying to get it to work. I emailed the developer a few times but it took a few emails before he realized that his program doesn't sync to the gears s3.,negative
9632,Great idea but doesn't show all events for the day; doesn't show events in designated colours (all look the same); doesn't show repeat events! No use really. I'm removing it from my phone.,negative
9633,"installed, looked like what I was looking for, loved the design. but the app makes me use the standard alarms and calander of my phone to put every bit of planning in, and I HATE the calendar on my phone, thats why I came here... to bad",negative
9634,"It's not working unfortunately. At first it was reflecting then when I added more items, it's no longer working. It just keeps adding the data in the calendar but no graph is being created",negative
9635,"Dear Developer, I have paid the amount for Pro version. After deduction still app is not get updated to Pro version. I have mail you the same issue & asked you to look into. Expecting immediate responce from you.",negative
9636,Worked for 2 days. Now I can't enter anything. I enter date time description hit save it says saved but nothing shows up on the lo k dial thingy. too bad nice. oncept. tho,negative
9637,"If you love complex chronographs and a tiny slice of color tells you all, then this app is for you. This is NOT a user friendly interface . Does not play well with 9.0 pie (but not much does).",negative
9638,It's a good app but there should be downloadble templates since it would take time and a lot harder to create your own design.,negative
9639,The wigit doesn't come with the free version. It does the same thing your Google Calendar can do. I was looking for something for time blocking ... this is time flopping,negative
9640,I just bought pro on my tablet 15 minutes ago and then installed Sectograph on my phone and it says I have to buy pro again. What the heck happened with syncing google accounts,negative
9641,Would love this to work. It says it is working (ticks against my Google calendars). Shows a few. Doesn't show most. Disappointing.,negative
9642,"Very nice app. Could be very useful, but unfortunately does not sync. :(",negative
9643,Looks good but it doesn't sync with events from existing calendars. It only syncs the holiday calendar but not my personal calendar.,negative
9644,"No longer work in Android 9. It can""t load meetings from Outlook or even from Google accounts. Interface is badly designed too.",negative
9645,"the planner does not work well. when I set it as every Monday, it shows different days.",negative
9646,I dont get it in google callender i set a goal to run 4:30 every morning but why on earth is it so that the app sets time on its own and when i edit it it is edited only for one day not the others,negative
9647,Did not work on my Amazon Fire 8. app just flashed abou a mile a minute and nothing could be selected.,negative

I read one comment for this app that it never gave a reminder for a scheduled task and yes I have an idea why it happened.",negative

When it finally showed up it doesn't have promissed functionality,negative
9868,I love the idea but there are syncing issues.  Events take forever to show on the graph regardless of whether i entered them in the sectograph app or my google calendar.  They show up in my google calender almost automatically regardless of the same.  Also i think 12 hour clock makes it tricky to read since the switch from am to pm is in the middle of the day.  I have something starting at 12:30 and i cant see it on the sectograph but there is a little arrow at that start time with the first letter of that event and nothing else.  It's confusing.,negative

10006,"If you want something that syncs to your calendar, you are in luck! It really is beautiful and such a wonderful idea.

I purchased it to be able to use it with my Samsung gear s3, little did I know that I can't use it with my watch bc this app was made to be used with android wear (which I found out later my bad). So, will you be working on making this app compatible with Samsung gear? That would open your market quite a lot with Samsung gear users. I've been using the wearable app with my watch but it doesn't work smoothly at all. Please work on that if you can, thanks!",neutral
10014,"It's pretty neat. I love the how everything pops out on the clock. Only thing is I tried scheduling things after 12 PM and it wouldn't pop up and I notice it only shows 12 hours at a time. If you buy the pro version it comes with the 24 hour feature, which I think is totally worth it. Seeing 24 hour option you can see everything from start to finish and not miss anything.",neutral
10015,"It doesnt seem to be possible to delete a single event in a series. So if I want to block off an hour every day for the same thing, but then I have to schedule a one-off thing during that time, I can't just delete one occurence and leave the rest of the future occurences alone. I love the app otherwise but this problem is pushing me toward a different app.",neutral
10016,I'm liking it but it seems to have some bugs. It's currently 01:13am but the widget and app are still showing yesterday's calendar sectors and event list.,neutral
10017,"Nice app! I just cannot work out what these random numbers are within the pieces of the pie... 35, 30, 7:35, 30, 8:35, 30, 8:35. it is clearly a countdown of some sort but bears no relevance to anything obvious. How can I remove these? UPDATE TO REPLY: Thank you, but I am seeing 7x this info around the pie and personally it serves little use. Can this function be disabled?",neutral
10018,I love the design and the app in general. I would give it 5 stars if it would allow to size the image and the information displayed.,neutral
10019,"The app is useful on the phone and tablet. I purchased it believing that it would also work on my smartwatch as displayed in the pictures. You will only get reminders, not a watch face. The picture of the smartwatch is misleading. Either develop the watch face app or remove the picture of it.",neutral
10020,"I would give this 5 stars, if not for the misleading in-app ""smartwatch settings"" extension purchase option.

If this app can be used on the galaxy smartwatches I would love to know how.",neutral
10021,"I love this app and use it with my watch but have been having a few problems. firstly I purchased the pro version off of my main google account. But the app is connecting to the other google account I have on my phone. I dont want to purchase pro a second time and the only way that I have found to disconnect it from that second account is by removing that account from my phone. Secondly, since daylight saving my events have been an hour off until I sync my events. Will change if probs are fixed",neutral
10022,I do not understand how I will add events. I tried adding events but it only shows up in my calendar not at the sectograph. It seems to be useful but I need to know how to make it work.,neutral
10023,I would've liked to use this app but sadly it doesn't seem to recognize European daylight saving time. I've gone through the settings twice. This is a deal breaker I'm afraid. I would still recommend people try the app however if the live in location where DST is rightfully ignored. The main concept is really clever and the widget is beautifully designed 👌👌,neutral
10024,This just displays your calendar as a time sector. Whenever you click on + it redirects to calendar.,neutral
10025,"I have changed my mind and have bought the 24hr clock version. once the app is fully updated and is working how I want it to use, I will review accordingly. I have gave 3 stars as it is the ""middle ground"" for now.",neutral
10026,updated:. was confused that the event list in the actual app wasn't showing events scheduled for the next few days. The widget will only show events in the next 12h. The event list in the app also only shows events in the next 12h. I think this list should list events for that entire day. this means i still depend on other apps for an agenda view.,neutral
10027,"Got this, loved the free version. paid $3.99 for PRO and still don't have the ability (or can't figure out how and there are no instructions) to set different calendars on two widgets on my phone. I'll be happy to give you 5 stars if you send me a how-to. Also, it says there is time tracking. Does that mean I should be able to do a start-stop on something while I'm doing an activity?",neutral
10028,Everything good simple and easy to use the best one but you dont get reminder as alarm so that you can actually know the schedule its just give a notification which can be easily ignored by mistake .....please fix this and link it up with alarm too just like you did with default calendar app,neutral
10029,"Hi! the range of the nuce coloured sectors does not cover the time interval of my events. It had been the best reason why I chose this app, to have an easy, straightforward overview of my plans. Why doesn't ut work as it is shown on the pictures?",neutral

10031,"Not really what I was going for. It's ok I guess if you want to use Google or your phones calender, but I wanted a detailed schedual with alarms to remind me to go to the next event. Love the look, but not useful to me.",neutral
10032,"Would be better if it didn't rely solely on Google calendar. Great concept, but would prefer adding events directly to the clock myself rather than having to put it on Google calendar first.",neutral

10036,It's an interesting tool but having one or 2 things on my calendar per day it does really make sense for me to use it. Looks nice.,neutral
10037,Sorry I dont get it. I have no idea why seeing my schedule on a circle is somehow better than a rectangle. What am I missing?,neutral
10038,It would be much better with an ability to have a report at the end of the month as to what was worked on and when. Ie statistics.,neutral

10046,Looks cool but I do not find it actually helpful unless you write down everything you do every hour every day.,neutral
10047,"nice, but there seems to be no way to hide declined events? that makes it much less useful. Would give 5/5 otherwise",neutral
10048,Its a nice app. Liked the design also. No option to copy paste same schedule to next day.,neutral
10049,any way to resize font so short events can still have a complete (or at least longer than 2 words) display?,neutral

Reminders I use all the time, if the widget recognised those then it would be far more useful to me. Would still recommend despite this.",neutral

10166,The app idea is quite great. The app itself needs to be improved thought. The clock keeps getting stuck on fixed times and updates the time only when we open the app itself. This defeats the whole purpose of the app. Definitely a 5 star idea. Needs better execution.,neutral
10167,"I was very excited for this app but there are a couple of things that have disappointed me. I really need a 24 hours clock, I have many events after working hours so as it is now it's useless to me. Moreover, don't know if this is my problem, I can't see reminders.

10389,"Now realize will not show appointments over 12 hours out, however would think should see them in overall list, but not on widget....good but could be just tad better.",positive
10390,"Very good Well, it's a great app. I just wish we had more free features. It would be a rmgrest investment.",positive
10391,"You can add one thing, when we'll touch on particular time period then the particular task should be displayed.",positive
10392,I really like the app. it's pretty cool! How do I get the 24 HR clock on my Android wear? 5 stars if the 24hr face can is possible on the watch! 🙂,positive
10393,"Nice App but not able to use widget (Nokia 2.1 , Android Pie)",positive
10394,Very good app! Helps me stay organized.,positive
10395,"Best watch once you understand it. It takes a while to set up just the way you want it and to actually ""get it"", but once you do it does exactly what it promises. Its sleek yet informative and by far the best ""at a glance"" app for your homescreen. The watch addon is the cherry on the cake. Only improvement in my opinion would be to add multiple different widgets. Like give me the option for a small simple one on my home screen and a bigger more detailed one on my office screen for instance.",positive
10396,I love this widget!! It's such a clear picture of the time and schedule!! My only thing is I wish it was compatible for the galaxy watch! I got the app because I saw it on the watch I'm the pictures but it doesn't work with the galaxy watch. 😕 If this was improved to work with the watch I would give it 5++ stars.,positive
10397,"Cool app! Can almost replace the other widgets I have on my home screen, but missing one feature (which is not the fault of the app, but a shortcoming for my particular needs): weather. Include weather and I can easily pay for this app! Still keeping as it is a good app!",positive
10398,"I've been using this app and the watch face on my Moto 360 for close to about a year now. With all my events for the day (and the next day) visible on my wrist, I can keep track of my calendar easily. However recently, the watch face is defaulting to 'Simple Clock' (default watch face) whenever I use the watch. It only affects Sectograph and it has been bugging me since.",positive
10399,"I bought the pro version and like it so far. For now what I'm really missing is the ability to change days from the widget itself, with the left and right arrows, and not only from inside the app. Why wouldn't you enable the left and right arrows to change day as default? Having to go into the app to review past or coming days defeats the purpose of the widget, and forces you to use something else other than the widget itself. Other than that, the app seems to be very practical. If the ability to swipe from one day to the next day or to the last day from the widget gets implemented, it would be a 5 star app for me. Thanks.",positive
10400,"I like it, also I would like, like a wedget but for the block screen. Then you don't need to open the phone, only activate the screen in order to see the next task in your calendar",positive
10401,A great tool to see what's going on in your day. I linked work and personal calendars into one. The customisable buttons are a nice touch and allow you to make it work the way you want it to.,positive
10402,"I think it's pretty cool how this app communicate with the calender, smart watch greatly enhanced the experience as well, good job. I just wish there was a galaxy watch version of it. :(",positive
10403,A very good Pie chart graphical view of your schedule with nice colours and everything is good about the app specially the graphical side. I'm not a pro owner but also rating 4 stars because of the glitch in app today. My whole sector were invisible today and it just showed blue colour filled circle with only an area of 45° looking as faded blue. And nothing else was there. I also have screen shot of the error if developers need it. Else it's a great app. Soon will buy the pro version.,positive
10404,This is so helpful! I use this with the forest app to stay on task. You can add different calenders from Google and keep work and personal separate.,positive
10405,"Its your calendar on a clock, best if you have a smart watch...I dont. But still a great app if your a visual person. 5 star if I ever get a smart watch!",positive
10406,I used to be able to tap on the widget and it opened but now it doesn't. What's the point of the widget if it doesn't open? *Was able to quickly fix in the settings. Thanks for the comment.,positive
10407,Good visual representation of my daily schedule and to-do list. A great way to remain mindful of how time is spent during the day.,positive
10408,Lot more easy and practical... maintaining calendar is fun...loved the widget,positive
10409,Very useful! Syncs with calendar and lets you easily see upcoming events and tasks,positive
10410,Very nice app and easy to use,positive
10411,Doesn't really sync with my calendar as events are added... *Edit: user error with delay in google calendar.,positive
10412,"It is a good app, really ok, but I don't like that, you oblige me to rate. This is a no go...",positive
10413,This app is very helpful but you need to control yourself to done schedule on time.,positive
10414,Unable to tap widget to open app and open calender since update!!!!! Thank you for response. Sorted,positive
10415,Nice app but haven't been able to explore it's full potential,positive
10416,Its great app & it should be complete free but of course nor maybe few updates.... Than I'll rate 5,positive
10417,Very helpful for busy scheduled hard workers.,positive
10418,Good app but need to something more,positive
10419,It gives a nice visual look at the day.,positive
10420,I started using this app in 11th std & I'm getting its benifit but the only thing is that it doesnt shows the tasks we have to complete in some monutes or if two tasks are to be completed simultaneously in a hour. So I humbly request to make some more changes in this app so that everyone can use it more comfortably.,positive
10421,"Neat, but I don't put that much stuff on my calendar.. Looking for more of a scheduling tool for everyday routines. Don't want to add all that stuff to my calendar.",positive
10422,"Pros: I loved the visual representation of events and Integration with Google calendar. Cons: It isn't integrated with Google tasks. Most of the users would use Tasks to track their activities, along with Calendars. I would love to purchase the Pro version and rate it 5 stars if integrated with Google Tasks.",positive
10423,Very nice setup. Thought enough of it to pay for premium. Couple things - add ability to change watch hand colors (arms match scheduled event making it impossible to see) - add ability to increase watch face inner diameter digital time (difficult to read). Watch = Ticwatch Pro 4g Phone = Moto Z3 w/Pie,positive
10424,Overall impressive app but it does not updated in real time. Always showing delayed time until manual update.,positive
10425,Only the first event added to the calendar gets synced to the sectograph app instantly. All other events takes quite a while to be synced to the app. Clicking manual update or relaunching the app doesn't solve the issue.,positive
10426,"Very nice and useful. Would be even better to be able to set less than 12 hour cycle, as series of short events inside short time period (e. g. a few consecutive stand-ups) are not easy to see.",positive
10427,Great for to do's and keeping on track with schedules. Notifications need to be adjusted. I don't always hear when they go off. And sometimes miss my stuff.,positive
10428,"I really love this app for so many reasons. Above all it's keeps me organized and punctual. What I wish I could change, or maybe I can and just can figure out how, is how to make the widget color pallet settings the same on my OS Wear. thats why I bought the extra options innthe first place. My watch face doesnt even look like it does in the photos. Can I change this!?",positive
10429,"This app is amazing. I use it to show all my Google calendar events as sectors on a 24 hour clock. I just have one feedback, I wish there was an option to divide the clock into two colored sector, based on from when sunlight is available and when it's not. The idea of ligh/dark period seems more practical than the usual AM/PM. Or maybe, provide a custom rotation to the dial, for eg., i would want the day to start from the time I go to bed. And thanks for this great app. Highly recommended.",positive
10430,"Really love the app. Helps me organize my time and schedule. If you could just make the hours numbering in front of the sector, and adding an option for showing minute division lines would really help to read it better. Setting the hours numbering outside the clock makes it look kinda crowded, and with some of the hour numbers (12, 3, 6, 9) not shown kinda bothers me. Also please make a preview of the clock in the settings so we won't need to switch from the app to the homescreen to see the changes. Really looking forward to see these features fixed. Overall, great app!",positive
10431,"EDITED - read second paragraph. Hi, not sure if I'm missing out a setting but the app does not display all the events in a day. It makes sense to show only the events in a 12 hr time frame on the clock face, but the list of events should include all tasks of the day -- instead of us having to ""fast forward"" the day until the events appear. I did not mean ""tasks"", poor choice of words on my part. I meant that if I have an event at 9pm today, and the time now is 6am, I will not see this at all. The clock face only shows 12 hrs: this makes sense. The list of events below the clock should probably show events for the whole day, though.",positive
10432,"I think it's by far one of the best apps out there. It integrates well with the default calendar app, and really helps you to track your day. Tons of customizable buttons, and even the clock face itself from the hour/minute arms colour and thickness/length, to the placement of the numbers on the clockface. I love how it displays the time remaining to your next meeting, task or alarm. Widget is pretty good and you have full functionality from the comfort of your home screen. Lock Screen display??",positive
10433,"Been using this app for a short while. So far so good. It's purely a visual of events, time, and alarms, while all the actual event management still happens through the Google Calendar app, and which I think is brilliant. Still figuring out the app.... Like how does one track time on it? 🤔",positive
10434,And this is definitely a good app for finding out your full day from start to finish in great detail. It has some pretty nice visual effects too.,positive
10435,I like it so far and I bought the 24 hours extension. The only complain that I have is the buttons that sit on the four corners of the widget is very hard to precisely click. I got very frustrated every time I try to click it. Most of the time it'lll trigger to move the widget itself. ☹️,positive
10436,"Made outlook play nicely by just importing my outlook calendars to google calendar. so that was pretty easy really.  I love the widget on my phone, it looks good, works nicely, it's awesome. The phone-clockface however can't be configured I can't find any option to add my business-calendar and some shared calendars to the clock face, it seems to only show my primary calendar (which apart from my own birthday is completely emtpy). (I'm aware that on Android one can select calendars, they just don't reflect over to the android watchface)",positive
10437,"Really great app, love being able to visualise my day! But it would be fantastic if the app (and widget!!) Could now sync with the systemwide dark mode on Android 10!",positive
10438,"This is an excellent application. The interface is fresh and new, and provides a new way to look at your day. I only wish that it could be made to be resized a little larger, as well as show all day events below in a list format as they are small around the bezel. Apart from that, it is a solid 5 stars!!",positive
10439,"Excellent and useful! I wish I had a smart watch to put it on but it's good on my phone too. Occasionally the widget can glitch and turn invisible but it will come back. The outside clock face numbers are only black? Can't see them on my background and can't figure out how to change them. The widget palette is great, but I can imagine customization with background images of clock faces, different hand shapes, and/or color gradients to make it look really impressive!",positive
10440,This app is the simplest thing yet it makes such a big difference in my daily life. I would only add the option to see the details of each task on the widget (right now it opens the app by default which is not a major issue but It would be an improvement). Thank you for making my life easier!,positive
10441,"Awesome new idea for a productivity widget. Significantly more useful than a calendar or list of upcoming events. the one thing I would like to change would be the display of numbers on arcs. It looks kind of silly near the center of the circle when the numbers twist and overlap. Change that, 5 stars.",positive
10442,"I like it a lot until you have overlapping times for your schedule or events.... It's too hard to tell which one you are looking at cuz it only shows one. Unless you touch it or open it but that defeats the purpose of it, it's for a quick glance. Fix that n ur golden.",positive
10443,"Do you have plans to support Office 365 and outlook calendars directly.   Currently, I am syncing my calendars to Google but it's not a pleasant experience as the sync keeps failing on one or other calendar.    Due to this reason, I am stopping sectograph and moving to outlook widget :-(  For those who are on google calendar, it's an excellent app and the developer support is awesome.   I'm rating 4 only for the dependency on google calendar.",positive
10444,I use this to help me see what my day looks like. The circular shape helps me related to easier. I know and I have open spots and I know and I am busy. It sinks with Google so I don't have to import information multiple times. Really like it.,positive
10445,"Quite useful little widget. I only wish I had control over which calendar it used. it seems to only pick up the Google/Samsung and I would like to use the widget for my repetitive schedule AND a second widget for my daily planner. There is the ability to select which calendar within the Google app I want to use, but that just makes the calendar side messy. Two separate app calendar selection would solve this for me, unless anyone has a better idea how I can get around this? Still, thank you dev",positive
10446,Very helpful. A bit hard to completely customize but much of that is due to how much flexibility there is.,positive
10447,"great so far, it would be nice to allow the 5 buttons on the widget have an option to skip a day, week or month forward or backward, if i would like to look ahead i have to open one or two apps when it could be a button you set on the widget. maybe even a button option that allows one widget to switch between multiple calendars, just thought id include that suggestion.",positive
10448,I really love this free app. It's so cool to see my schedule visually and know how much time I have until the next event. The only thing I would change (and this may already be available in the paid version) is the ability to choose different colors for each event.,positive
10449,I give it 4 stars but needs main edits: 1. There got to be alerts to remind one of the activity.. not just notifications. 2. Widget should be on lock screen beside being on the home screen. 3. This app can have the option of overcoming or controlling other apps; as to prevent distraction of following the routine.,positive
10450,"Great app, switch between the widget and calendar directly. It can be improved, but is great in its current form. For some reason the widget disappears sometimes, needing to be re-added, which is annoying.",positive
10451,"Had written a bad review because I spent a week trying to make the app show two widgets with different calendars. Couldn't do it (and wasted hours!) until I noticed a nearly invisible dot (at least on my screen, I'm using the iblue app) near the widgets. Pressed it and discovered the widget menu! They should really make it stick out or write clear instructions about it on the app. I imagine they try to make it subtle in order to not affect how the app looks, but it took a week to find it.",positive
10452,"Nice app, 4 stars for interface, somewhere overmuch filled with great variety of little numbers, quotes, and other things , which sometimes could cause eyes-bleeding, as an evident consequence of an attempt to find out what for they are here.",positive
10453,"It's probably the closest app to what I'm looking for. I'd really like to be able to either style or disable monochrome mode, and have the option to use the same style between the watch face and home widget so I don't have to go back and forth in the settings to make them match",positive
10454,My favorite aspect of this app is the visual organization of my daily events! It's a great little widget for people who need to keep track of their life but literally always forget to open the calendar app. I would like to see more color custom options 😊,positive
10455,"It's a great app and the watchface is a perfect addition, but it would be even more perfect if the 24h mode was a feature of the watchface. (And an option to switch between 12h/24h mode and open meetings by tapping the sector.)",positive
10456,overall a good app to manage your tasks. A good planner with nice UI and charts.,positive
10457,It's a neat idea and I've I tweeked the display settings I was able to make it easier to read. There are some features that could be explained better though. overall it's a interesting way to see what's on your schedule.,positive
10458,Very cool app! Only thing I found is that when I update and remove an event from my calendar the widget doesn't update. the event stays in the widget. Also wish it had a setting to show battery percentage. Still like the app though:),positive
10459,"Im really keen to use this app, but the fact that it doesnt have an alarm bugs me a lot. I tend to glance over things easily so an alarm that I have to stop after reading my next event will be incredibly helpful.",positive
10460,"Nice app. Nice design. But, I don't understand what is a point of ""notice"", cuz if I want to see it I need to be into the app. Notice need to come with ""notification"".",positive
10461,"it is a very nice way to look at your schedule. It also helps you determine productivity, whether you are scheduling efficiently and are you allowing yourself some downtime. It can use some improvements and I believe that they will happen.",positive
10462,This is a great application to view the events in your day. Easier to see compared to the traditional calendar app. One improvement that I would like to see is the ability to see future events by pressing on the widget itself instead of going into the application.,positive
10463,I've really enjoyed this visual approach. This is the first time I've used a digital schedule of anytype and been successful. I bullet journal and use a planner.,positive
10464,"The most effective way to organize and follow your tasks, it is brilliant,! The only downside is that it does not have desktop version, I hope they will fix this gap soon.",positive
10465,"Love this app, has really helped with sorting out school, work, fitness, and study time into my schedule.  Only reason it isn't a 5 star is the lack of a watch face for my Galaxy watch.",positive
10466,helpful for those who are visual or have a hard time grasping timeframes. still learning all the features. Demo mode is helpful but a full tutorial video would be more helpful.,positive
10467,love it. however when it says homescreen I thought it would show up on the homescreen of my phone... but I order for me to see it I have to open the app. so not as helpful as I thought it would be. is there a way to make it part of my homescreen where is is always present?,positive
10468,I like this app. I wish the 24 hour mode wasn't a part of the pro version I would like to try it before I purchased but I like the visual of my day on the graph and the sync with my calendar or is now my main screen in my phones screen.,positive
10469,"This app's PERFECT for helping manage one's time! I'm amazing how much better I do, when I can actually look at it and literally see my time ""flying"" by.",positive
10470,"I like it, but I wish I could go to the days ahead and see everything planned instead of what is just at or ahead of the time right now. For example, it is 5pm right now, and I can only see what's happening after 5pm tomorrow.",positive
10471,I love the look of it and how it helps me see my schedule! I don't like that not all my events show up on the widget. If it worked like it was supposed to it's a five star app!,positive
10472,"Love the design, although the rolling 12-hours takes some getting used to. Very helpful for me to be aware of how much time I have available before an event",positive
10473,"Does not include connectivity with Google tasks or similar tasks software, which is, at least for G-calendar users, lamentable! The very idea and design are superb though!",positive
10474,"I'm still getting my way around the app/functions. so far, its proving its worth. like to find a way to connect to alarms n reminders.",positive
10475,The only drawback of this app is that you need to add events or tasks or routine to your Google calendar in order for it to show it in the app. It would be great if such events could be added on the app itself.,positive
10476,"Great idea... functional & easier to read vs. traditional calendars/reminders. Still learning it, but I think that I am going to really like how useful it is. Thank you!",positive
10477,Excellent time management and gives you a real sense of your day. I would however had liked to be able to change dates to see how other days are looking.,positive
10478,I like how it gives a different visual of my schedule the only thing I would do differently is make it scalable for phones. It doesn't expand to the boundary box like it should when resizing,positive
10479,I wish there were a few basic color options in the free version. But this is good enough that I'll buy the full version when I catch up on other bills lol.,positive
10480,it's a really good app it helps you keep track your meeting or work and it is really good for students they can manage there time really well with this app and the good thing about this is that it reminds you 15 min earlier that the timer,positive
10481,"Instead of just giving me a clock for practice. Give me an app for accountability, something in which I can see my entire day at one place and I can manage accordingly. Make it simpler guys.",positive
10482,Superb concept. But not able to sync outlook calendar with app. Rather it's picking events from local mobile (oppo) calendar. Want to sync outlook & gmail calendars. Please help,positive
10483,Great App. Keeps me on task and organized. Freezes a bit and didn't show all of my planned events. I had to reprogram but other than that no issues at all.,positive
10484,"Great app, the only two features that would make it even better: 1) Add option to hide declined events (this should be simple) 2) Recreate it as Samsung Gear watchface.",positive
10485,"Great visualization of my day , but feel there's a little too much at once, maybe more options to toggle parts - widget is the best part",positive
10486,Good app,positive
10487,"It is a good app, really ok, but I don't like that, you oblige me to rate. This is a no go...",positive
10488,Nice app. Quite original,positive
10489,It gives a nice visual look at the day.,positive
10490,"Good app. I agree with other reviews, the addition of tasks will make it great. Update: The new edition seems to be less useful. It seems one need the pro version to get it to work well.",positive
10491,"Good app, but not exactly what I was looking for. This app uses your calendar events and organizes them in the circle. The controls are great, I love when I move the red time bar it scrolls through all the things and shows the time changing. Love the widget. I wanted this to work out a homeschool schedule. I ended up having to make a new calendar and syncing only that one. I was able to change the colors of each event in the app. Very easy to use overall.",positive
10492,"Very good Well, it's a great app. I just wish we had more free features. It would be a rmgrest investment.",positive
10493,Needs improvement,positive
10494,Its a neat app,positive
10495,"You can add one thing, when we'll touch on particular time period then the particular task should be displayed.",positive

10506,Nice,positive
10507,"It took me a while to understand how to use certain features, but once I did I found it to be EXACTLY what I needed!

10516,I love this widget!! It's such a clear picture of the time and schedule!! My only thing is I wish it was compatible for the galaxy watch!

10517,تطبيق جميل ويساعد حقا,positive
10518,Good 👍,positive
10519,Good,positive
10520,This is so helpful! I use this with the forest app to stay on task. You can add different calenders from Google and keep work and personal separate.,positive
10521,Really good,positive
10522,Good application 👍,positive
10523,É um aplicativo pra quem é visual se você ê mais chegado a listas não recomendo o uso. Mas é um aplicativo muito bom para ver seu tempo livre e o tempo que você gasta com tarefas relacionadas a eventos,positive

10534,A very good Pie chart graphical view of your schedule with nice colours and everything is good about the app specially the graphical side. I'm not a pro owner but also rating 4 stars because of the glitch in app today. My whole sector were invisible today and it just showed blue colour filled circle with only an area of 45° looking as faded blue. And nothing else was there. I also have screen shot of the error if developers need it. Else it's a great app. Soon will buy the pro version.,positive
10535,Nice,positive
10536,Its great app & it should be complete free but of course nor maybe few updates.... Than I'll rate 5,positive
10537,♡♡,positive
10538,Very useful! Syncs with calendar and lets you easily see upcoming events and tasks,positive
10539,I used to be able to tap on the widget and it opened but now it doesn't. What's the point of the widget if it doesn't open? *Was able to quickly fix in the settings. Thanks for the comment.,positive
10540,Beautiful,positive
10541,"I bought the pro version and like it so far. For now what I'm really missing is the ability to change days from the widget itself, with the left and right arrows, and not only from inside the app. Why wouldn't you enable the left and right arrows to change day as default? Having to go into the app to review past or coming days defeats the purpose of the widget, and forces you to use something else other than the widget itself. Other than that, the app seems to be very practical. If the ability to swipe from one day to the next day or to the last day from the widget gets implemented, it would be a 5 star app for me. Thanks.",positive
10542,"I've been using this app and the watch face on my Moto 360 for close to about a year now. With all my events for the day (and the next day) visible on my wrist, I can keep track of my calendar easily. However recently, the watch face is defaulting to 'Simple Clock' (default watch face) whenever I use the watch. It only affects Sectograph and it has been bugging me since.",positive
10543,Unable to tap widget to open app and open calender since update!!!!! Thank you for response. Sorted,positive
10544,Great app.,positive
10545,It is better to have more choices In time repeat Like I want do some jobs in some days of week Wendsday sunday and monday,positive
10546,Its good for me and it really helpful,positive
10547,It is a very helpful app,positive
10548,Very nice setup. Thought enough of it to pay for premium. Couple things - add ability to change watch hand colors (arms match scheduled event making it impossible to see) - add ability to increase watch face inner diameter digital time (difficult to read). Watch = Ticwatch Pro 4g Phone = Moto Z3 w/Pie,positive
10549,Very Good!,positive
10550,Need to update the calendar more..... otherwise perfect,positive
10551,Great and helpful app. Love it,positive
10552,Very helpful. A bit hard to completely customize but much of that is due to how much flexibility there is.,positive
10553,How do I put on homescreen?,positive
10554,Very useful app,positive
10555,Apk बनाने का विचार नया है पर उपयोग करने में कठिन मैनेजमेंट और पेड भी !,positive
10556,Only the first event added to the calendar gets synced to the sectograph app instantly. All other events takes quite a while to be synced to the app. Clicking manual update or relaunching the app doesn't solve the issue.,positive
10557,Very nice app. Very useful to be productive.,positive
10558,Very cool,positive
10559,Delete imformation I had typed in. Didn't understand why it kept taking me to my google calendar,positive
10560,"Pros: I loved the visual representation of events and Integration with Google calendar. Cons: It isn't integrated with Google tasks. Most of the users would use Tasks to track their activities, along with Calendars. I would love to purchase the Pro version and rate it 5 stars if integrated with Google Tasks.",positive
10561,Good one,positive
10562,I enjoy the countdown to my next event. Very helpful.,positive
10563,Sometimes it won't sync but overall works good.,positive
10564,Excellent idea. Great for visual based learners,positive
10565,simple and clear,positive
10566,Useful app,positive
10567,"Very nice and useful. Would be even better to be able to set less than 12 hour cycle, as series of short events inside short time period (e. g. a few consecutive stand-ups) are not easy to see.",positive
10568,"Simple, easy to use, and very helpful.",positive
10569,Great for to do's and keeping on track with schedules. Notifications need to be adjusted. I don't always hear when they go off. And sometimes miss my stuff.,positive
10570,"Starting days i can,t tell more but its effective",positive
10571,overall a good app to manage your tasks. A good planner with nice UI and charts.,positive
10572,Not Bad..,positive
10573,Good,positive
10574,The app looks like it will be great but it has only picked up half of what is on my calendar.,positive
10575,I am unable to set sectors properly as shown in your sample screen shots. Please help,positive
10576,Great app,positive
10577,Great app,positive
10578,"Really great app, love being able to visualise my day! But it would be fantastic if the app (and widget!!) Could now sync with the systemwide dark mode on Android 10!",positive
10579,And this is definitely a good app for finding out your full day from start to finish in great detail. It has some pretty nice visual effects too.,positive
10580,Brilliant app,positive
10581,Very intuitive app.,positive
10582,Nice app & very useful,positive
10583,How to set the widget on my home screen?,positive
10584,Good apps for time allocation in a different design mode,positive
10585,Almost confusing but I think it's ok,positive
10586,"The app is really great and don't even need the paid version. Unlike what people said, I found it quite easy to set up. I wish the ""custom repeat"" had option to choose which day of the week and not the frequency of days, as my schedule varies (schema as : 4 days A followed by 3 days B). I really love the widget option also. I just downloaded it but if I keep using it then I will consider buying the pro version to support the creators.",positive
10587,"This app is fantastic! I work from home anyway, and with the disruption due to the Coronavirus, it was difficult to maintain my usual schedule. By the end of the day, I hadn't accomplished much and really didn't know where the time had gone. I downloaded Sectograph and it has made all the difference. I am getting my work done and even have free time to enjoy. I even recommended it on Twitter yesterday.",positive
10588,"brilliant! I absolutely adore this app. so easy to set up, makes using google calendar for agendas even easier than just using google calendars! the events on the clock face just clicked instantly for me, the fact that they can be colour coded is delightful. the widget is great, and even shortcuts from there can be personalised. I got the pro version even though the free one does everything you need it to. having 24 hour option is good though, and even more colour customisation now. LOVE it!!",positive
10589,"This is the App I never knew I needed. I got the free version because it sparked my interest and upgraded to the full paid version within a day. Maybe I'm wired to see my day in the way they present it or maybe Sectograph is wired to appeal to me, I'm not sure. Either way their widget is the top half of my home screen and I am more in touch with my schedule than I ever have been.",positive
10590,Really great. It takes some time to get it working - my current use is to input what i plan to do the previous day either at night or through the day when i discover what needs to be done. Jotting down your plans is more effective than you might think to productivity. Ill keep using it and get back when i discover more tips to be more productive.,positive
10591,"This initially looks a bit confusing. However, this design actually functions extremely well. The way it can act as both a clock, date, alarm and agenda widget at the same time is just incredibly efficient. It also provides you with a very easy way to evaluate at which times of the day you have events and more importantly: when you have breaks and how long they are. All this at a glance, compared to clunky agenda widgets where you have to sit and calculate it in your head. Well worth the money!",positive
10592,"An amazing app, helped me to become more productive and disciplined. Only downside is is that I wish it was compatible with my laptop so that I can always be reminded of my time schedule. Other than that, an amazing app. Would totally recommend this!",positive
10593,I like it. What I would really like to be able to do with it is to set it on my homepage to where as soon as I open my phone my schedule is right there in place of my clock. Food for thought 😁. Thanks! Edit: wow! Thanks! Developer responded to my query within hours. Changed from 4 to 5 ☆☆☆☆☆!!!!,positive
10594,"A nice application with a interface designed to have the ability to give you a reminder, heads-up for coming events. It seamlessly absorbed info from my calander, alarm clock and prayers(Salah) reminder. Keep up the good work",positive
10595,"Started using this about a year ago and it quickly became a fixture on my home screen. It functions about as you would expect out of the box, which is nice because navigating the customization leaves a little to be desired.",positive
10596,"The best scheduling app I've used so far. Easy to view at a glance, and connects directly to your calendar. No complaints.",positive
10597,This is one cool app. Not only is it useful but it also has an aesthetically pleading footprint.,positive
10598,I'm not making full use of this app yet. But it's a very handy widget for busy folks to visualise their agenda for the day.,positive
10599,This app is really great. The best part about it that it's connected to Google Calendar,positive
10600,"At first it appears cluttered, but it won't take you very long to figure it out and by then you'll love it.",positive
10601,Very clear and easy to use app. The paid version is so worth it. Having your daily schedule displayed on a clock is SO nice for my ADHD,positive
10602,"Wonderful app, unique and very useful, great design and functionality.",positive
10603,"Brilliant app, helps me to keep track of everything I'm doing!",positive
10604,This app reminds me everytime I forget about something important and it's all organized.I ❤ this app.Thank u so much for making this app.,positive
10605,"Such a cool App!!!! Exactly what I was looking for, and so easy to use.",positive
10606,Beautiful graph/calendar. I love how beautiful and practical this is. I love it,positive
10607,"Perfect widget for your home screen, all your events in the same place on a clock.",positive
10608,"This applications are, all there setting up you routine for the day and you can set appointments in advance.",positive
10609,Very useful app for keeping track of the day!,positive
10610,Extremely useful once you get a hang of how it works.,positive
10611,A great way for a visual person to outline and track their activities,positive
10612,"This app is awesome, I love the wear os compatibility. I have a couple feature requests. It would be great if you could filter which calendars you can see on the greyscale mode. Also it would be nice to have an option in the settings for making the watch 24 hours always, currently if I restart my watch it switches back to 12 hours, so I have to turn on the tap to toggle feature, tap my watch, then turn off the tap to toggle feature since I don't want to accidentally switch it back.",positive
10613,Amazing app... Helps in staying organised n focused whole day....,positive
10614,"Love it. It is a great app with a very beautiful yet minimalistic design. I was looking for some watchface that showed my calendar events and this is perfect. The homescreen widget for the phone is great, too. And all of that for free, excluding some minor features like 24h time and in-depth customization. I can definetly recommend this app. 👍",positive
10615,"I bought the Pro version a few weeks ago...great concept. A few things I would like to change but can't find it in the instructions or in other reviews. Is there a way to remove my alarm clock icon on the clock face--it's irrelevant, didn't ask me to place it there, and takes up precious space? Also and most importantly, I would like the hour hand to reflect the ""real time"" so I can visualize instantly how much time is left until the next scheduled task is due. For myself, having to press the arrows to move the hour hand and watch a countdown timer to the next task is of no value. If the hour hand issue can be addressed to reflect ""real time"" I'll give it a 5, otherwise the App wont work for me and it stays at a 3. I'm surprised no-one else has mentioned this and I'm wondering if my install developed a slight bug. Update...Jan 20, 2020... I received prompt response from developer...fixed issues. My phone was an older Note3 running Android 5.0 so it was a bit different...works fine now...changed to 5 stars.",positive
10616,"It was good because: -It had the time in form of a clock -It told you the time before a session -It told you the time each session lasts But since I dont have premium, it doesn't let me choose different colors, which is not too bad. Yet, i would like that option for free.",positive
10617,"..very useful..i think i'll be using this for a lifetime.. ..for further improvements or updates, i wish there could be more premium functions for free 😅, more event color options, more readable layouts, etc..but i hope no update could ruin this already very functional app like what happens to other good apps..🙏",positive
10618,Es great. Good enough for me to use it to help fix my sleeping pattern.,positive
10619,"Does what you want exceptionally well, plus the paid version enables deeper customization. Well worth it, the free version is very useful and I do not regret paying for the premium features. Love it.",positive
10620,"An awesome app. I've never seen a daily planner like this. The widget is great, and its designed in such a creative and useful way. Easy to use. Excellent, will keep using for daily life.",positive
10621,Excellent super app. Gift my god. Thankyou,positive
10622,Its a nice app a plesent representation of what you put in your task list to-do list or meeting list . Learning the app and for myself getting everything to sync up properly took a little bit of patience but I got it and all's good.,positive
10623,"Perfect. The home page clock & calendar widget I wish I had years ago 😢. So easy to have a glance and see what tasksand events are coming up for the day in a really compact way. Great functionality, customisation and options to add app/task shortcuts in/or around the widget.",positive
10624,Good optimization and beautiful widgets,positive
10625,Realistic approach on time management. 😇,positive
10626,"Great concept, but not quick to use. Creating events through Google Calendar takes time, I would like to be able to use without syncing to any calendar. Perhaps add an option to store events locally instead of syncing to outside calendars. And make that process quick and ease Edit: Thank you, I have found that option!",positive
10627,"If you use Google calendar and like circular visualizations of your schedule, this is a must have. I paid the premium charge for the full set of features so I can see a 24 hour calendar view, and I'm going to buy and ""Wear OS"" smartwatch to use this app's smartwatch sync feature to see my widget on both my watch and home screen. Perfect!",positive
10628,"This is a very convenient little app that can have quite a big and positive impact on your daily routine, especially if you work on a lot of different projects. For me, the indicated time between events is very helpul in planning breaks. Must-have for anyone who is looking for a clean and effective way to manage their schedule. Well worth the purchase! ^^",positive
10629,Cool app to visualize ur schedule and make it easier to plan your day. A really cool customization system and integration with some non-default calendars is great. Bought a premium right after first day,positive
10630,Useful widget to view the schedule of calendar. What I like the most is I can just activate one event of Google Calendar and see it in the widget. Was looking for this type of app for a long time 👍,positive
10631,"Great experience, it would be great if it has some rotation feature, so that we can rotate the wheel and it shows the task as per indicated position. Thanks",positive
10632,Great app for visualizing your schedule and the inbetween duration of events (actual time of events and time left)!!! Really loved it and I treated myself with the pro version for colour customisation and 24 hour display! GREAT APP. ☆☆☆☆☆,positive
10633,"Like the structure of the daily appointments. So much easier to see my day at a glance. [Edit] Unfortunately I had to delete b/c would not update additional entries. Hence, 5 to 2 stars. [Edit 25Dec] I've noooo idea what changed to be fair probably system update or Google calendar. Regardless sync works beauuufifully! And absolutely delighted. So much so I purchased Pro (feed the peeps that make good stuff!) Thanx!",positive
10634,Supper helpful for me as a busy college student. I often forget all the things I have to do each day and this helps me visualize what's next. I want to get an Android Wear just to have this app also on my wrist. It's that helpful. Also I just bought pro and I love the colors! Please keep the support and updates coming. Thanks!,positive
10635,I love it! Exactly what I was looking for for a loong time. I've used it as my main home screen widget for over a year now -- synced with my daily schedule set up in Google calendar. I recommend the 24h layout.,positive
10636,This is a very helpful app for those working on time management. The home page widget helps keep me on track throughout the day.,positive
10637,"Very good app easy to use and has a great interface, very easy to follow and set up all of your daily plans.",positive
10638,One of my favorite app to view my planned tasks as a graph when helps for a quick visual of what's next and when. Thanks for the app.,positive
10639,"Was literally just about to upgrade to pro and install on my new Fossil Gen 5, unfortunately the watch face does not work. It worked before when I had a Ticwatch last year, so is there a reason it's not showing up on the Wear OS app? Edit: Got a response immediately over email and was able to troubleshoot my issue. Y'all also earned a pro member 👌",positive
10640,Its a really good display of the day ahead. Exactly what i needed and it works great with the local calender.,positive
10641,Classy and useful. It tied in with my calander with ease. I like the look and I like seeing it in my screen. It really is a simple way to see what you have going for the day quickly.,positive

10658,Great and even better for ADHD,positive

I highly reccomend trying it. 3/ The widget has pride of place on my homescreen, and my Android Wear watchface. The designer has done an incredible job of cramming all the important information into the widget, without confusing or overly cluttering the display. There are many useful customisations that I found easy to control.",positive

10786,"I loved this app so much after I downloaded it and used it for about 2 weeks. Because I loved it so much I decided to purchase the pro full version and payed £4.99. However, it was not worth paying at all. I would have rather used the free version with the ads. I will recommend everyone to download the app and use the free version but dont get the £4.99 ad free version because it doesn't really give you anything extra. I would recommend the creator of the app to add more features for payed.",negative

10788,The tutorial doesn't help and shows you nothing the app is very bad and isn't easy to understand I have given up after wasting time trying to figure this trash out. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.,negative
10789,too many ads and require to pay for applications that are commonly found in play store.,negative
10790,App not work after purchase...plz dont buy. User Interface not good. Beacuase eralier version is good..,negative

10797,Terrible app it didn't let me put my whole schedule in and it insisted me to buy the premium version which I'm not going to do 4.99 for an app that doesn't even work that well no thanks bye . And it restarted my whole damn thing like wth bch.,negative
10798,"The app would be nice if it actually gave you a tutorial on how it should be used. It seems almost like clickbait, with one appealing look and then it's not what you expected or needed. Yes it's very organized and but nothing is explained.",negative
10799,"Does not refresh on Samsung phones. I have done every troubleshooting step and more, to no avail.",negative
10800,I found it odd that the app didn't have preset hourly reminders. Most people have habits that require them to do them on specific hours (for example; gyming twice or thrice a day) the app should have a feature on where you can input the exact times in the day when it should remind you Another example of this would be:  Reminder: on every Thursdays at 7am and 8pm I should be reminded of (insert habit).  Instead it's jungle of toggles that seem to not make sense,negative
10801,"This app started out great. Everything was so organized and I was happy I had a digital schedule with reminders to carry with me. But it stopped giving me notifications, it also stopped showing my reminders all together. I wanted to uninstall the app for a while because it's never working, but today was the last straw. I had a reminder put for my midterm, but of course since it's such an awful app... it didn't notify me. I missed my midterm. Screw this app, don't download it.",negative
10802,Why this app requires so much of settings in one time.. 1)Like it should be in recent apps..2) If internet is off it doesn't works..3) Even though all the permissions to app is allowed in phone settings.. Than to it crashes.. It requires an immediate update with all the bugs fixed soon. Or people wouldn't even write a review.. They would uninstall the app and find better alternatives.,negative

10804,"I'd like to give it a 5 star, VERY MUCH. The app is very useful, convenient and easy to use and what's even better is that it allows the user to modify the alarm (sound, icon, etc) as we please that makes it much easier to organize our schedule. But the app no longer works after i've changed my phone, i don't know if the issue is about my phone (i used Mi A1 before and oppo currently) or the app. I've read about the configuration to get the app back to work but to no avail, please help. Ty",negative
10805,"this app isn't optimized for use, it's just a concept. for example, the alarm plays music but can't be shut off. there's no ""acknowledge alarm"" so if it starts paying music... yeah it never stops. this is only one of many bugs so bad it breaks the app. don't waste your time.",negative

If the other option is the recommended one (which I hate that it adds an alarm icon in the status bar. other apps work without doing this), it doesn't mean the other one IS NOT WORKING. Bad.

10998,EDIT: Even just an option for the horizontal interface would be great! Thank you for taking my review into consideration! Please please please! Bring back the old horizontal interface.

For example, I need to set it to 1 hour and 30 minutes, but there's no option for that. We need the ability to enter exactly the number of minutes and hours we want, instead of only having presets.  EDIT: Now after using it for a while, the app has been plagued with reliability issues. It often is late with the notification by a few minutes, or the service completely stops and I'd have to restart the service. Due to this issue, I cannot rely on this app for anything that is time-sensitive because I'd end up being late for all my appointments and jobs. I've contacted the developer multiple times about this but so far they haven't been able to fix the issue.",negative
11053,"A core function missing is the ability to disable a routine/ daily 
occurrence for a specific day. For example, I usually exercise from 6pm to 
8pm every day, so I created an event that happens every Monday to Friday. 
Today is a Thursday and due to an unexpected occurrence, I can't exercise 
today. I wanted to change that my 6-8pm block of time just today, but can 
only do so by deleting the event for EVERY Monday to Thursday to clear my 
timeline. Makes no sense to clear that block of time and need to re-create 
that exercise block for all the other Monday to Fridays. If something 
unexpected happens at 6pm next Friday, I'll have to delete it ALLL, and 
recreate all over again after just to clear my timeline. If you get this 
core feature right, then the app would be complete.",negative

it use to be so easy to simply move routine blocks around and now it's

that I found this app to do very little more than any calendar. After

adding anything is done in the same way you create a calendar event. The 
""routine"" function is a missed opportunity in that I think it will help me 
establish a morning routine for myself but in reality it's about creating 
calendar events that repeat, a slightly expanded component of any free 
calendar our there. When I think of ""tuning my time spent"" I'm thinking, 
better organization for smaller tasks. Then find myself spending an hour 
setting 1 minute events for myself that I was never actually notified about

The default ""end"" time is ""until next activity"", but then it automatically changes to the start time of the next activity and you can't change it back. Then, if you add a task that overlaps other start times, it deletes the other activities. I spent 15 minutes setting up a schedule and was frustrated to find that I had erased my entire afternoon schedule because I made a mistake when changing the end time of something mid-day. This app was, for me, ironically, a waste of time.",negative

Changing existing routines is very hard as it simply deletes whatever overlaps in time. So unnecessary and impossible to revert. If you accidentally click PM instead of AM once, your whole day is deleted permanently.

it use to be so easy to simply move routine blocks around and now it's

after the update.",negative
11163,"A core function missing is the ability to disable a routine/ daily

Today is a Thursday and due to an unexpected occurrence, I can't exercise 
today. I wanted to change that my 6-8pm block of time just today, but can 
only do so by deleting the event for EVERY Monday to Thursday to clear my 
timeline. Makes no sense to clear that block of time and need to re-create 
that exercise block for all the other Monday to Fridays. If something 
unexpected happens at 6pm next Friday, I'll have to delete it ALLL, and 
recreate all over again after just to clear my timeline. If you get this

11176,"I regret buying this app. (TL;DR: don't use this app if you ever intend on changing routines or planning.) Changing existing routines is very hard as it simply deletes whatever overlaps in time. So unnecessary and impossible to revert.

The default ""end"" time is ""until next activity"", but then it automatically changes to the start time of the next activity and you can't change it back. Then, if you add a task that overlaps other start times, it deletes the other activities. I spent 15 minutes setting up a schedule and was frustrated to find that I had erased my entire afternoon schedule because I made a mistake when changing the end time of something mid-day.

I would like to see more personalization options t'wards the look af the tags and app. Choices now are very slim. The $5 price tag for the pro version doesn't feel worth it (yes, buyer's remorse), so if you can manage fine with the free version, stick with that.",neutral

11194,I like the ideas of the app. However the biggest inconvience for me is when something happens that disrupts my routines. There doesn't seem to be anyway to change the routine for one day with out changing it for every day in the futurs as well. It is annoying to have to manualy change a routine and then have to change it back the next day.

11203,"Tried this app for a bit. The logic is very different from what I need, so the experience wasn't good. This app focuses on routines and is built around this concept. It was very confusing at first (because it started with abstract ideas, not what average joe is already familiar with; e.g. calendar/timeline) and the entire experience just felt awkward. For me, all I want is, see the day/week/month, add to-do items one by one, and be able to turn any of these items into routines when I want to.",neutral

However, that isn't what happens. There is no notification from the app for the alarm. I receive other notifications from the app. Running out of room to explain.",neutral

I'm really disappointed with the new look and that vertical scrolling through. Makes it so much harder to use - it's easier to start changing the wrong day since the current activity is not highlighted in any way, and starting time is not that clear as before. Also, those activity/free time blocks take too much space, yet there is not enough space horizontally for the text and a lot of the additional tags aren't visible. I'd prefer a more compact look. It would take a lot of time getting used to this...",neutral
11209,"I bought the pro version in hope I can organize my time to do my tasks, but the progrmer just disables the routine, that's all!!!! really?!!! the other thing I didn't like was to set a routine for a reoccurring like school or sleep I had to set it for every single day, one by one!!! you could have add a reapet feature to it. I'm not happy I wish I could get my money back!",neutral
11210,"I have been using this app for about a year now without any issues, so I'm definitely not fond of the new routines menu. I find that swiping from side to side for the days to be much easier and having the drag and drop feature to be more comfortable (Hope it will be implemented again soon). Also the fact that you can't move a blank time frame up and down makes it difficult to set up the routine. As I have to change the time of every item to move it down. I would prefer the old version, hopefully it all gets fixed soon.",neutral
11211,This app is useful. BUT. It would be so much more useful if you could set a routine to be repeated every weekday/ weekend day/ week/2week/4week/month/etc. It is badly in need of this feature. I thought buying pro would allow me to do this and it hasn't helped at all and I'm disappointed I spent the money. Please say that it is an upcoming feature. Resetting routines for every day is really inconvenient!,neutral
11212,"Great potential, but I can't use the app to its full extent due to its counter-intuitive layout. Just filling two days in Routine view turned it into an endless scroll. Shame, the app really looked like what I was looking for. Reply: Thanks for taking my review into account. Yes, I think a horisontal orientation would be much better. Maybe leave both options? That way everyone can decide what best suits them.",neutral
11213,"It's really only useful if you are doing recurring tasks at the same time, on the same days, etc. I set up a lot of tags (categories) but they can only be applied to the routines, not events or reminders.

11214,"Decent app, but i was having issues with scheduling my week with it. Any time i tried to M-F (day schedule) it repeated the same schedule perpetually, even on the weekends, regardless of setting day limits or time constraints. Will check back on this one.

11216,I think the old version is better than the latest version. Hope that there is an option to choose between the horizantal or vertical interface. The shifting of days from left/right is easier than the new one. I barely use the app since the change of interface. Ive been using this for a very long time and it was really helpful.,neutral
11217,"While it has helped me be more productive, recently the notification settings are bugging out. When I tap on 'ADD notification', and select a louder notification (for when I wake up) and press done, I find out sooner or later than it had reset it to the ""opener"" (my default notification sound that is quiter). This has caused me great annoyance because of this and do not know why this app decided to bug out!",neutral
11218,"Not bad but not great. Pros: 3rd party calendar sync, time line view, icons & colour options to customise. Cons: can't sync devices, no task list or tick box. More options needed such as daily time line view, font size & highlight current day. Editing isn't easy & I think the whole app including widget could have a neater, tidier look. Overall it's not very intuitive, needs more options & flexibity. It has some way to go. I've got premium btw.",neutral
11219,Its good. i like the little picture icons. i wish for 2 things: that you can share as a jpg file and not a txt file to email. and that the length of the boxes represented the amount of time used. for example: snack time would be a short box. sleep would be a long box. thanks!,neutral

11222,"It would be nice if there was a warning what certain buttons do. I was trying to figure out how to change the day from day one, clicked clear day, and it erased my entire schedule. It should say clear routine if that's what it does. I'm a little pissed as I just paid for the app so I can make a schedule. Still unsure of how to do what I need.",neutral
11223,"Looks promising. Would like to see: routine sharing/sync (some routines you have to do with your wife), marking activity as done, have tags on timers and have more analytics on the actual timeline data (not routines).  I personally would pay a premium for these features.",neutral

11401,"Tried this app for a bit. The logic is very different from what I need, so the experience wasn't good. This app focuses on routines and is built around this concept.

For me, all I want is, see the day/week/month, add to-do items one by one, and be able to turn any of these items into routines when I want to.",neutral
11402,Difficult to use and doesn't show name of activity only when I click on it,neutral

There doesn't seem to be anyway to change the routine for one day with out changing it for every day in the futurs as well. It is annoying to have to manualy change a routine and then have to change it back the next day.

11511,Good,neutral
11512,Good app and nice after the latest update,neutral
11513,"I used to have 5 stars, but then the layout changed and I find it incredibly difficult to organise. I'll go so far as saying I hate it, it's just soo much. I want to have a separate view for each day not an endless scroll like some facebook timeline.",neutral
11514,"I liked it ,nic one. thanks!",neutral
11515,Pros: I like the layout. I like the ease of entering tasks. I like the widget. Cons: No check off when complete. No accountability tracking. It just didn't help at all with keeping me on task.,neutral
11516,"I have been using this app for about a year now without any issues, so I'm definitely not fond of the new routines menu. I find that swiping from side to side for the days to be much easier and having the drag and drop feature to be more comfortable (Hope it will be implemented again soon). Also the fact that you can't move a blank time frame up and down makes it difficult to set up the routine. As I have to change the time of every item to move it down. I would prefer the old version, hopefully it all gets fixed soon.",neutral
11517,Hell,neutral
11518,"Decent app, but i was having issues with scheduling my week with it. Any time i tried to M-F (day schedule) it repeated the same schedule perpetually, even on the weekends, regardless of setting day limits or time constraints. Will check back on this one. (Might be my device thats the issue idk) Gui was clean and simple, and you can set specific alarm sounds.",neutral
11519,It hard to use,neutral
11520,I don't like the new update. It's very confusing. I can't use it anymore :(,neutral
11521,"I like the new ""Jump Day"", and ""Insert Gap"" options, and the Advice/Delay dialog for multiple activities. The Undo feature is a great addition as well. I'm really disappointed with the new look and that vertical scrolling through. Makes it so much harder to use - it's easier to start changing the wrong day since the current activity is not highlighted in any way, and starting time is not that clear as before. Also, those activity/free time blocks take too much space, yet there is not enough space horizontally for the text and a lot of the additional tags aren't visible. I'd prefer a more compact look. It would take a lot of time getting used to this...",neutral
11522,App is overall amazing Only thing that I was missing that there is not any feature for prioritising the activities. Hope the developers will add it soon.,neutral
11523,"It would be nice if there was a warning what certain buttons do. I was trying to figure out how to change the day from day one, clicked clear day, and it erased my entire schedule. It should say clear routine if that's what it does. I'm a little pissed as I just paid for the app so I can make a schedule. Still unsure of how to do what I need.",neutral
11524,Just add 'To Do List' feature. Highly recommend.,neutral
11525,"Please also add the option to import few activities from any day instead of the whole day onto timeLine of a routine. Further please add the feature of allowing a to start a routine custom routine Using time interval instead of defining exact time, because on some bad days due to unavoidable circumstances we are out of schedule and adding a fresh custom timetable for the day hurts a lot modifying Timings for every activity. For rest of its features it worth 5*****.",neutral
11526,"I like this app i really do. However one caveat i feel is that it can only sync to a gmail or the native phones calendar. Outlook calendars are not supported as far as I can tell. So for me, I work with outlook, thus any meetings etc cant be viewed seamlessly with respect to a current timeline plan.",neutral
11527,If there is some problem... regarding some phones than you must overcome that... Rest of all things application is great.,neutral
11528,"Could be a lot better. I wish we were able to check off items in our 
routine as we finish them so we can move on to the next task. I would also 
like to see a timer associated with the routines so we can see if we are 
falling behind or are ahead of the time we have budgeted. I have my morning 
routine, but it has multiple tasks within it. If we were able to condense 
my tasks into the routine, it would make things look more organized. All in 
all a very good app if you want to stay organized, but I don't think I 
wouldn't use this app until the mentioned points are added. If these all 
exist already, please let me know- because I couldn't figure out how to get

often than not I have some event I'd like to add and shift around my 
routine. This is not possible at the moment (using programmer for 2 out of 
3 days is meticulous just so I can add 1 event). It would be good to have

11557,"Good lord... you have to set EVERY LITTLE DETAIL of EVERY SINGLE THING (to get any sort of good results I mean). It feels so unintuitive to have over 25 ""taps and tweaks"" you have to perform for every single item you enter into this. Plus having something you need to do that's instant (like a social media post) has to have a ""start and end time"" and won't let you enter anything less than 5 minutes hahah are you kidding me? At this rate it would take me LONGER to organize my schedule than to just do everything the unorganized way. I'm using an app called Time Planner instead which is still pretty lengthy to set up but much more intuitive",neutral

11565,Great but basic in design and you cant not preview things such as sound. Its basic to use but some features are a little annoying like all the tags in one place. Id like the option to categorise.,neutral
11566,Apparently I rated this app one star this time last year but I don't remember what the issue was so whatever you guys did up to now with improving  the app is good. Unfortunately I'm heavily dependent on having a calendar view(not Google calendar integration but rather an option to display days via calendar) so until it's put into the app I will be uninstalling and standing by for the update.,neutral

11587,"Great app to plan out your weekly schedule, especially for a college student. However I wish it would show the amount of time being spent on each activity on the widget.

11588,"Great app, very easy to schedule. I think it would be great if there is a button from the notification panel that allows muting of all events for the rest of the day. Another feature could be the user can push forward or backwards the whole timetable (or pushing forward the event and shortening another) from the popup for unexpected event that delays everything",positive
11589,This app is great so far. But I wish there was an option to select several days at a time for each routine.. if there is already pls let me know.,positive
11590,Its a good app but i dont understand how in the picture they got their timeline like all their routines all my one has is the days of the week and to make a routine you only get two additonal tags im confused how did they get so many?,positive

I'd like there to be different colored backgrounds and text colors for past vs current vs future activities. I want to see at a glance what I ought to be doing at that moment, without opening the app. I'm keeping the app installed, in the hopes that the widget will be improved. Thanks, dev!",positive
11600,I have found this app helps me stick to my daily schedule.,positive
11601,"I'm liking it so far. It's a very customizable experience, and I can really get into the details without the interface being too complex. I would like to see more widget options for the ap on the home screen. I like to see my schedule and routine the moment I open my phone. While there is a widget, it's rather lack luster. Synced with the programming, I think it would be cool if they had a calendar widget available.",positive
11602,"I like this app because it's better than another app I found and is really good at reminding me to stick to schedule. But I gave it four stars because even though I haven't had any issue with this yet, it does have in app purchases wich I don't think are needed here. But overall if you need to plan a day or routine, use this app.",positive
11603,Love this app. Helps me a lot!,positive
11604,"Nice app! Super helpful to plan anything, recommend it. However, it would be nice if you could at a to-do list function? That way I could tick off the things I need to complete for one time only, such as homework. Good work tho!",positive
11605,Rarely(read never) do i write reviews but this app has been transformative for my life and productivity in general. The only issue i sometimes have is the custom song i apply to notifications doesnt always play,positive
11606,This is my favorite daily schedule app! It is so simple to use and super versatile. I paid for the pro version just so I could do everything and it was well worth it!,positive
11607,I'm struggling to see the use of routines and programmes right now. But the other features are really useful. Would love the option for a task's or to do list!,positive
11608,"I love this app and I definitely recommend, just sad that the timer wont be available in the app anymore, it was very useful",positive

11611,"Very nice app for maintaining our schedule... Need to improve sechudule reminder, not working properly..",positive
11612,Could you allow me to add activities on my timeline because my routine and plan is always changing and cannot be limited to a fixed routine. I use this as a daily planner to plan out my full days and weeks ahead of time so it would be good if i can add activities far ahead of time.,positive
11613,I'd like to see an option to mark parts of my routine as complete.,positive
11614,For god sake change the default color this red is burning my eyes,positive
11615,Have re-defined my routines and activities. Working well.,positive
11616,"I really love TimeTune in helping me better utilize my time, see where it is all going and plan routine tasks so that I can stay on top of my busy life. The only thing missing for me is the ability to tick things as completed and cross if not done. I'd love to be able to analyze my routine to see what worked well and what I struggled to acheive. I find it rewarding and motivating being able to check things off as done.",positive
11617,It has a button just for what I need...I bit hard to read the scheds though,positive
11618,Good and helpful but the notification alarm does not snoozes automatically . The notification stays on the notification bar until not removed. Pls keep a limit till after which it should snooze.,positive
11619,"Excellent app!! I use it every day. I've got a few small requests though, if possible! Another app I tried had the option to drag & drop timelines to reschedule times, e.g. make things a little shorter or longer. It's not an absolute necessity, but I find it a little clunky having to edit each event in turn, although I do love the ""add this gap to previous/next activity"" option. Also, not a necessity but would be a nice touch - I'd love to be able to reorder my routines. Couldn't figure out why they were all in a funny order, but it arranges them alphabetically, and since I make a routine for each day of the week, they were all very jumbled up. I've solved it for now by adding numbers to the start of each name, but again, just slightly clunky. As for the rest, I absolutely adore it. Love the persistent notification; each time I pick my phone up absentmindedly to check my notifications, I see what I'm meant to be doing, and it gets me back on track. Thank you!!",positive
11620,"I like all the scheduling possibilities and tools. I'm giving it 4 stars because the alarm I have set thru the app can't be turned off. I had to uninstall it, just to get it to turn off. Very annoying.",positive
11621,"Great app! The app offers very interesting and unique features as well . But there is only one problem for people like myself. I spend most of my time doing some work on my laptop, and I try as much as I can to ignore my cellphone whilst working. If only I could manipulate and change my schedule in TimeTune accordingly on my laptop or pc it would be perfect.",positive
11622,"Good app but it needs more work. I gave it four stars because its missing a premium selection, that is an overview of your activities so one can see total time spent on what. This could be in a form of a pie, bar, or line chart. You can include all so we have a choice. With this anyone can now keep track of time spent on a daily activity and limit time spent on said activity. So far good work work guys.",positive
11623,"My own structuring of little tasks and routines improves with this app. I really like the app, but I would also like it on my laptop. It would be great if you developed an option to install and use it on both devices, as I don't always have my phone on me while working. Or did I miss something? It doesn't allow me to install the app on my laptop, it only shows that it is already installed on my phone.  Looking forward to your response. Thanks in advance!",positive
11624,I really like this app to establish a new routine. I strongly rely on my calendar at work but setting it up for routines outside of work is tedious. At first it takes a moment to understand how repeating activities are set up but now it's a great tool! Feature suggestion: it would be also really great if you could include a habit tracker into the same app.,positive
11625,"It's a good app and being able to route alerts through different sound channels is a great idea. I've found a bug though and couldn't find a way to contact you about it besides here: It's daylight savings today and while timetune has the correct time, for some reason it has pushed forward all my events by one hour. So an event which says it is happening at 6:30 is now on my timeline as 7:30. Hopefully its just for today.",positive
11626,"I really like this app. The concept of blocking your times is great and I find it helps me structure my time really well. It's also a load off of my mind knowing that I don't need to think about when to eat or what time to check my email because I am at ease knowing it's all planned for and I will be informed accordingly. My only disappointment, with the service and not the app, is that I am unable to structure my timeline online on a PC. I think there are limitations of the mobile device that makes the scheduling somewhat confusing. I think it will be perfect to incorporate a way to set up your schedule on a nice large screen and use your phone for viewing and notifications.",positive
11627,"Used to love this app, amazing UI, simple. Definitely one of my favourite, and so helpful. This new UI thought, not for me... Too much clutter and scrolling! Tried to get used to it but its not for me, so it's time to let it go. Useful non the less, so try it, maybe it's your thing! Edit: I don't know how to answer so I'll edit and hopefully it gets trough. If I can get something back, I would like the choice to go horizontal (make it a choice on pro). A bunch of horizontal scrolls is not a problem if instead I have to do a bunch of vertical ones. Looks less intuitive to me. And I can use the go-to option, but I kinda already could and never did. I liked to scroll horizontal, because I liked the view that it gave me, and the side comparison of days on same level.",positive
11628,"This is the best time blocking app I've found, but it still has some significant pain points. I wish there was a desktop version, since creating/updating blocks would be 5x faster with a keyboard, mouse, and large screen. Editing would be faster too if blocks could temporarily overlap, and if routines were per day instead of per week.",positive
11629,"I just tried this app and I am already compelled to buy the premium version. I think this app has many potential, please make more simple UI so that when we're looking at timeline it doesn't feel so cluttered. A minimal look will be so much better. Look forward to more addition to the app and more great features.",positive
11630,"Great app and I want to import my calendar so that I can replace my calendar widget with it, but I cant buy the pro version. I tapped purchase once to see the price, then hit cancel in the google pay modal. Now whenever I tap to buy it I get a modal saying that in app purchases are not enabled on this device. Google Play Services is installed and works normally with other apps (and worked fine the first time I tapped to buy).",positive
11631,"Well I like having an agenda where, if needed, I can be reminded of what I need to do. However, I am not liking how after 3-5 days of reminders, it just stops doing it and I have to go in in order to refresh. At this point a normal calendar app preinstalled would be better, since I can set it to remind me every day. Could this be fixed?",positive
11632,"Great for maintaining and keeping a routine. This is detailed enough to develop any kind of daily/weekly/monthly routine, and flexible enough to incorporate out-of-routine events and distractions if you use it right. It is a bit tedious for some people, (that's why the 4 stars) but they can keep it simple and high-level if they like. But, if you really want to tame that beast called your work week, school agenda, or personal days like me, this will take care of it.",positive
11633,"Really helpful app. I've looked at lots of other schedule apps, but this one is the easiest for me to customize precisely. Great for making routines! Since a few of my routines overlap, it would be amazing if there were an option to see routine titles in the widget timeline above or before the task, in order to keep an overview of which/whose routine is in effect. Both of my children have their own different weekly routines, so it would be nice to see on the timeline, that for example, it's kid#1 who has school on Monday mornings and kid#2 on Monday afternoon instead of two ""time for school"" tasks with no specifics. It would also be great if this app could be accessible from my computer desktop or if I could sync with other family members.",positive
11634,"After installing and uninstalling several other apps I finally found this one and it suits my needs the best. I like the appearance and all the features. There are two things I'm missing however - subtasks and the possibility to tick off every single completed task or event for the specific day. This would make this app a perfect tool for me and I wouldn't mind to pay for it. As a busy mom battling depression I need a simple tool to help me to organise my day and week, and to remember my tasks.",positive
11635,I wish to buy the pro version and also encourage my friends and family to do the same but hope you can make some improvements to the app. The UI looks very minimal which is a vanilla android template for an app development. Please make the UI a bit more appealing. We would have also like to do routines that are repeated in intervals of more than 15 days. Present app doesn't allow me to set a monthly routine. Hope the icons can be more rich and appealing.,positive
11636,"Great so far, two requests for devs. I just started using TimeTune and I like it, has most options I was looking for to help my time management and utilize time blocking Requests; 1: Whole Week View - I'm looking for healthy rhythm and repetition in my weekly routine as an independent worker, difficult to visualize when I can only view one day. 2: Sharing - I'd love to be able to share my routine with my wife through this app. Perhaps two ways to share; ""by whole routine,"" and ""by tag.""",positive
11637,"so far so good! relatively easy to use. I was really hoping to be able to check off routine items when completed. trying to build up on habits. so it would be great to be able to track completed progress. calendar sync in pro verson went seamless! however when i go to change a routine item because it conflicts with a calendar appointment,there is not option to just edit that one Tuesday. its either all Tuesdays or no Tuesdays. It would be great to see date options & completed progress tracking",positive
11638,"It's the best app for organizing my days. But I have a little bug, when it's running in the background I don't get notification about my new activity and I have to refresh the background data to resolve this problem. It would be great if you could fix this little annoying bug.",positive
11639,"Would be perfect if: - You could update cloned activities, meaning if you changed one all of them would change too - You could check off the activities like a to do list (it works as a reward system) - You could scroll up in your timetable to see what you did that day/things you missed because it only shows everything from that point in time forwards. Otherwise really love the design and layout, and it makes me super organised.",positive
11640,"I like this app a lot. One thing that stops me from buying pro version is that I desparately need it to export routines to my Google calendar (now I think that it is just possible from Google calendar to TimeTune). That is because the interface of TimeTune is much, much better than Google calendar interface, and I need all my routines in Google calendar in order to sync it with my Google Home speaker, so it can read it out loud every time I ask and remind me even without my phone.",positive
11641,"Good app does what you need it to do, a little light on instruction or where to find them as i know the app has more functionality, but don't know without some digging where to find it, also wouldn't mind if the Pro version had more features to entice people to buy it or if the free version had a few adds per day for the dev. 😊",positive
11642,this app is great but i have a problem. the timeline after a while says this app has been blocked by your system and its gives two options. 1) troubleshoot and 2) Refresh background task. This ptoblem is occuring every time. The troubleshoot isnt helping me. I have a vivo phone. please help!!.,positive
11643,"Edit: I use comments to add reminders about what I'm specifically planning to do to complete each task day by day, like grocery lists and assignment titles. I would really like to be able to add comments for just one cycle of the routine and have them disappear after the week restarts. I thought it might be useful to have this function on the timeline page rather than the routine edit screen, which seems to only be useful for permanent comments. I hope this makes sense!",positive
11644,"Great App. Like the options of multiple routines, calender, and reminders. However I wish there was more control over the routines. I'd like to be able to pick the start of my day instead of it starting at 12am. I'd also like to be able to pick what week days for a routine to be active so I can have different routines each day. You can manually program it if you pay for pro version but it's a hassle to go day by day if the routine is going to be used for months.",positive
11645,"A great app for setting routines, simple to use and very customizable. A slight learning curve for the routine setting, eg. The +/- symbols. A few things that could be improved: easily assigning routine for each day rather than programming a period of time (from the pro version) or the same routine (from the free version). Also the widget could be more useful if it indicated the ending time as well. The comment text style could also be better differentiated title/tag of the event.",positive
11646,"I really like this app, especially the routines. I've given this 4 stars and will change to 5 stars once there is better online sync, a web interface, and a way to sync with Google calendar. Also, tablet adaptation would be good. This app has a lot of potential.",positive
11647,"Ok so i bought a pro version. It is a decent app but has some issues. I created a few routines but when using programmer I can't apply them based on Day of the week instead I have to choose date. For example on every Monday, Wednesday and Friday I have a different routine but on Tuesday and Thursday I have a different one. But using programmer I can't apply routine based on day of week ( have to choose a date instead).",positive
11648,"App is great for student's and other people who lack time management skills.As long as your remain objective and honest to yourself,this app will work to help you be more efficient with your time.This is one of those apps that has the potential to change your life when used correctly.Good interface and simple structure.Give it a chance!",positive
11649,"New update made me little bitter(in routine section ) ,kindly take it back and give the old one. In the routine section , first the app allowed me to edit the routine of daily easily and separately , but now all the days are one by one and not side by side , actually side by side is best and easy to edit , thank you for your reply :-)",positive
11650,Just completed my first schedule. I have high hopes for this app. I had a couple of suggestions that I think would improve the user experience. one would be collision detection when you try to make a new routine with an existing enabled technique.,positive
11651,"This app is really very useful, but it would be better with a feature that import the routines created to other calendar apps (through gmail or some sort), as for laptop uses. 🙏🙏 Other than that, it is awesome, would definitely recommend to my friends, keep it up!! 👍💪",positive
11652,Wanted vertical and horizontal in routines like before and not to display that alarm clock. Thank you for your feedback i love it.,positive
11653,"very nice app... adds pop up randomly but not bothersome... very useful to set up a routine to follow :) good work developers!! quite flexible but could work more like a calendar ... that way each day is tailored as you like... but i also like the option of having set a routine once, it applies for as many days as you want",positive
11654,"very good. it is a bit complicated to use. It should probably have a tutorial or an expailnation about the different functions, as some of them just seem to be the same thing with just a differeent look. (i could just be stupid, which is a possibility).",positive
11655,"Really well for procrastinators and forgetfulness!! I constantly forget things but this keeps me on track. I will admit though that the tags should have an option on sorting them (clicking and dragging them to be in a specific order) other than that, perfect app and no issues so far!!",positive
11656,"Hey, Great app, though recently I have started to experience an issue. The app is continuously asking me to refresh the background task, and as a result it's not consistently showing notification, if i forget to do so.",positive
11657,Easy to use to schedule repeat event alarms. Easy to create different routines and turn them on or off. This feature was helpful for me. Only item missing is a time tracker for client jobs or training specific tasks. Even manual tracker would be good.,positive
11658,"Great app, easy and simple to use. The ability to save different schedules and just toggle each or all of them is perfect. Have some seasonal schedules that I can just turn on or off as required, while keeping other routine schedules.",positive
11659,"It's a great app is great for reminders.the only thing is that it doesn't always refresh automatically, meaning that if you're too busy to do it manually every so often, you're going to miss your reminders...",positive
11660,This is a good app with loads of potential. It integrates really well with Google calendar with the only slight disadvantage that you can't choose to hide or dismiss all day events. The widget is great and the notifications seem to work well. I look forward to seeing more updates.,positive
11661,It's an essential daily time management app.It can further improve by providing the more detailed analysis and auto suggestion for the activity based on past routines.Further the routine creation can be simplified by providing the 1 step auto update functionality along with individual task creation functionality currently provided.,positive
11662,"good app, but not what im looking for. i'd like to be able to check items off my routine as i complete them, but i cannot do that. i do like that there are a variety of tags to choose from, and that i can create my own tags. i also like that you can clone a routine over several days.",positive
11663,"Clear and nice design, works perfectly. It would be great when calendar synchronization would also export routines to my calendar, so I am able to manage my routines in the app but main events in the calendar app with blocked time of routines.",positive
11664,love the simplicity.... really works for setting core routines... not for every tiny extra thing that you want to add beyond your core routine but great for setting new daily practices and keeping you mindful of over-investment in certain tasks and procrastination.,positive
11665,Excellent app for time management and routines. I love how customizable tags are and how versatile the difference between routines and events are. I just wish there was a deeper Google Calendar immersion so that I could edit icons and add tags to imported events.,positive
11666,Very nice app and easy to use. My only complaint is that I wish there was an option to have a weekly view in block format like a planner versus just the timeline. But it is still very convient to use the routines.,positive
11667,I liked this app. I would like to recommend one more thing. Please add the schedule to calendar as well. As right now it is getting all calendar events. But it will be great if all the schedule will also get saved at calendar.,positive
11668,"How do I ""push back"" and/or ""bump up"" a daily routine? *Edit: They answered my issue. Other than needing an easier way to do what I mentioned above, I love this app. Very easy to use and very started. I love that you can create your own Tags too.",positive
11669,"App is artistically awesome! However, I find it a bit annoying that once an event or reminder is over it removes it from the weekly view, I love being able to reflect on my day and imput things i may have missed to have a full scope of my day",positive
11670,This app is damn near perfect. But you know what would be awesome? Being able to check off each complete tasks by adding a check mark. I would even pay for that feature. Make my life a lot easier.,positive
11671,"It is a great app, love the design and the possibilities. But it really needs tk have a setting to change the hour configuration from a clock to keyboard so we can edit the event and routines in a split screen.",positive
11672,"it's absolutely amazing and helps me organize my life the features are great and customizable, i personally love the fact you can have more than one routine it makes it simple to switch my reminders when i have different scheduled weeks",positive
11673,"It is absolutely amazing, only as a teenager i have no money to buy the pro version. Even without the extra features, it's awesome. Although the tags are annoying.",positive
11674,Its a great app for those who understands the precious value of time. It takes time to set your own schedule but once you start....its fabulous... Keep modifying it to get best of it...,positive
11675,"I couldn't find any other app that allows for routines with cool schedules and calendar features. I love how it tells me how much time I have left in the day. The ""when the day start"" setting confuses me though...",positive
11676,"Good organizer. This apps is lovely to look at and good for scheduling. It is more for idealized schedule as it does not really let you adjust during the day if something comes up. Overall, good.",positive
11677,"Just downloaded the app and noticed that I cant have 2 events overlapping eachother? My example is to be in the office (for my job) and do schoolwork. But i categorize these as two different events and want to be able to see them as such, so I know everything I am doing. Please add this!",positive
11678,"Fantastic app, great layout and super helpful. Editing entire routines can still be a bit cumbersome, but it's better than any other routine/calendar/daily scheduling app I've used.",positive
11679,"I definitely like this app. However, I can't rate it 5/5 because it erased all of my routines this morning, so it's been a bit of a tedious process trying to reprogram everything back in.",positive
11680,This app is good to schedule your daily routine on a weekly basis...I liked it.. But I could be better if we could log our actual activities time also and if this app could show a comparison between what was scheduled and what is actual,positive
11681,"I liked this app very much. It helped me schedule my time. That happiness didnt last long, as it kept shutting down often. If that problem is sorted out, then this is one of my life saver app. Thumbs up!",positive
11682,"Would love to be able to remove tags that already exist, or at least edit them. I'd like to be able to use different icons and colors for specific named tags that already exist. And if I make any mistakes on a new one, it's permanent.",positive
11683,"Fabulous and simple, yet amazing, design. It has the right tools to organize my time. Can wait for the new features coming up.",positive
11684,Only thing missing is being able to check off each task/event. I'd like to know that I am making progress of keeping the routine or of I need to tweak the routines a bit.,positive
11685,Helps me to plan my day! What I'm missing: widget shows comming events only and you can't see the previous events. So when you are a bit late the widget is not helping.,positive
11686,Good app,positive
11687,"This apps quite easy to use and looks simple. Just it doesn't really meet my requirements, it can be better if it got the calendar and tickbox. I've purchased it but it still like the same. It said sync to my calendar but it didn't shows what I've planned in my google calendar. The only thing I am satisfield is the notification sounds.",positive
11688,Not upto the mark but its okay. Ads give ptoblem and ui is little weak.,positive
11689,"Developer responded to my issue quickly and politely. App is pretty good so far, maybe a little more clarity is needed about the user interface for dummies like me :) Like an arrow to indicate I can swipe for the rest of my schedule.",positive
11690,I think the app really helps you stay organized. It really helped me out. The only complaint I have it that you have to pay for the premium version but I mean... how else are you supposed to be able to make money off of an app so...,positive
11691,Real good. You star focus on you schedule and all the dead times,positive
11692,"Make some more widgets, rest all app is nice and user-friendly",positive
11693,Can sync it to laptop?,positive
11694,I love this app and the idea behind it with the weekly and daily routines. I wish I could view my month or week at a glance however so I can see my weekly routine and how my non reoccurring events affect and lay out with my routine.,positive
11695,Decent,positive
11696,Easy to use and very useful especially spending lots of time at home at the moment,positive
11697,"A great app but i miss a overview of week activity's, the app get confusing to use after adding some tasks",positive
11698,This app is great so far. But I wish there was an option to select several days at a time for each routine.. if there is already pls let me know.,positive
11699,"Fine app. Would be perfect to have desktop web version also, to make adding routine much easier.",positive
11700,Amazing helps manage your time and habit formation,positive
11701,Good app and really helpful with time management and staying organized,positive
11702,It's simply the best for time allocation to activities and routines.,positive
11703,😐😐😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘,positive
11704,Nāo é exatamente Oque estou Procurando,positive
11705,"It's an excellent app but I would ditch the ads, you shouldn't need theme with a premium version available. They make your app look cheap and distract users.",positive
11706,Nice app It helps a lot to save time. You will understand where you used more time and where you should spend more time.,positive
11707,Beautiful app for personal growthv,positive
11708,A liked because is simple and clean,positive
11709,Love this app. Helps me a lot!,positive
11710,"Great app, very easy to schedule. I think it would be great if there is a button from the notification panel that allows muting of all events for the rest of the day. Another feature could be the user can push forward or backwards the whole timetable (or pushing forward the event and shortening another) from the popup for unexpected event that delays everything",positive
11711,It's good,positive
11712,Its a good app but i dont understand how in the picture they got their timeline like all their routines all my one has is the days of the week and to make a routine you only get two additonal tags im confused how did they get so many?,positive
11713,"Great app to plan out your weekly schedule, especially for a college student. However I wish it would show the amount of time being spent on each activity on the widget. It shows it when you go into the app but that's less convenient and helpful if you want to do a quick check to see how much time you have for today's lunch break.",positive
11714,Very easy to use plus best time route app available,positive
11715,I have found this app helps me stick to my daily schedule.,positive
11716,Good and helpful but the notification alarm does not snoozes automatically . The notification stays on the notification bar until not removed. Pls keep a limit till after which it should snooze.,positive
11717,It's good,positive
11718,"Nice, tho I would like to be able to name a routine and give me a notification of the name",positive
11719,"Give A Option For Time Range, Like : Sleep 7Hrs But Not From Start To End Cause We Cant Follow That Much",positive
11720,I'd like to see an option to mark parts of my routine as complete.,positive
11721,"UPDATE: This app is great! But I'm currently not using it. I'm not using it because the widget colors don't work for me. I'd like there to be different colored backgrounds and text colors for past vs current vs future activities. I want to see at a glance what I ought to be doing at that moment, without opening the app. I'm keeping the app installed, in the hopes that the widget will be improved. Thanks, dev!",positive
11722,"I love this app and I definitely recommend, just sad that the timer wont be available in the app anymore, it was very useful",positive
11723,I really love this app but notifications are not working at all even after i allow all the permissions. So I'm not able to use this app.,positive
11724,"I'm liking it so far. It's a very customizable experience, and I can really get into the details without the interface being too complex. I would like to see more widget options for the ap on the home screen. I like to see my schedule and routine the moment I open my phone. While there is a widget, it's rather lack luster. Synced with the programming, I think it would be cool if they had a calendar widget available.",positive
11725,Great app.. Please fix.. Alarm popup not autohides.. or show longer time ex 5-10min,positive
11726,I'm struggling to see the use of routines and programmes right now. But the other features are really useful. Would love the option for a task's or to do list!,positive
11727,Wanted vertical and horizontal in routines like before and not to display that alarm clock. Thank you for your feedback i love it.,positive
11728,This is my favorite daily schedule app! It is so simple to use and super versatile. I paid for the pro version just so I could do everything and it was well worth it!,positive
11729,Rarely(read never) do i write reviews but this app has been transformative for my life and productivity in general. The only issue i sometimes have is the custom song i apply to notifications doesnt always play,positive
11730,It's amazing,positive
11731,"Very useful, but a feature to postpone events more easily would be nice.",positive
11732,For god sake change the default color this red is burning my eyes,positive
11733,Have re-defined my routines and activities. Working well.,positive
11734,Useful. Good notifications,positive
11735,It has a button just for what I need...I bit hard to read the scheds though,positive
11736,"Very nice app for maintaining our schedule... Need to improve sechudule reminder, not working properly..",positive
11737,"Nice! ,There is all i needed in this app.",positive
11738,"I like all the scheduling possibilities and tools. I'm giving it 4 stars because the alarm I have set thru the app can't be turned off. I had to uninstall it, just to get it to turn off. Very annoying.",positive
11739,Good app,positive
11740,"I like this app because it's better than another app I found and is really good at reminding me to stick to schedule. But I gave it four stars because even though I haven't had any issue with this yet, it does have in app purchases wich I don't think are needed here. But overall if you need to plan a day or routine, use this app.",positive
11741,Could you allow me to add activities on my timeline because my routine and plan is always changing and cannot be limited to a fixed routine. I use this as a daily planner to plan out my full days and weeks ahead of time so it would be good if i can add activities far ahead of time.,positive
11742,"It's working really good so far, I've been looking for something like this for so long. Thank you.",positive
11743,"Nice app! Super helpful to plan anything, recommend it. However, it would be nice if you could at a to-do list function? That way I could tick off the things I need to complete for one time only, such as homework. Good work tho!",positive
11744,"I really love TimeTune in helping me better utilize my time, see where it is all going and plan routine tasks so that I can stay on top of my busy life. The only thing missing for me is the ability to tick things as completed and cross if not done. I'd love to be able to analyze my routine to see what worked well and what I struggled to acheive. I find it rewarding and motivating being able to check things off as done.",positive
11745,"I got many work many problem but with this, this app can give me something new, i can manage my daily activities, this is my solution live for me",positive
11746,"Good app, just one suggestion, consider putting a weekly template with times on the side, its much easier to follow and visually appealing",positive
11747,"Really well for procrastinators and forgetfulness!! I constantly forget things but this keeps me on track. I will admit though that the tags should have an option on sorting them (clicking and dragging them to be in a specific order) other than that, perfect app and no issues so far!!",positive
11748,I liked this app. I would like to recommend one more thing. Please add the schedule to calendar as well. As right now it is getting all calendar events. But it will be great if all the schedule will also get saved at calendar.,positive
11749,Good for saving time,positive
11750,Great and simple to use..,positive
11751,Good,positive
11752,"Still need to improve on routine like day of every first week, every second week of the month.",positive
11753,It's very nice.but how to get Time line on home screen,positive
11754,"A great app for setting routines, simple to use and very customizable. A slight learning curve for the routine setting, eg. The +/- symbols. A few things that could be improved: easily assigning routine for each day rather than programming a period of time (from the pro version) or the same routine (from the free version). Also the widget could be more useful if it indicated the ending time as well. The comment text style could also be better differentiated title/tag of the event.",positive

11756,"Clean os, lots of features",positive
11757,Took a bit of time to learn but so far its a great app. Definitely appreciate the ability.to set passive or more aggressive reminders.,positive
11758,Everything I wanted and more! Finally has updated almost to perfection. integration with Google fit or samsung health and or any gear would be amazing!,positive
11759,Can I have a feature where I can maintain a record of how many times I actually finished the activity I was putting in? Include that and it's 5 stars from me.,positive
11760,Nice app,positive
11761,Nice,positive
11762,Adding function of goal list eg. the work has a goal and the goal shall finish in which days.,positive
11763,"Really helpful app. I've looked at lots of other schedule apps, but this one is the easiest for me to customize precisely. Great for making routines! Since a few of my routines overlap, it would be amazing if there were an option to see routine titles in the widget timeline above or before the task, in order to keep an overview of which/whose routine is in effect. Both of my children have their own different weekly routines, so it would be nice to see on the timeline, that for example, it's kid#1 who has school on Monday mornings and kid#2 on Monday afternoon instead of two ""time for school"" tasks with no specifics. It would also be great if this app could be accessible from my computer desktop or if I could sync with other family members.",positive
11764,"Great so far, two requests for devs. I just started using TimeTune and I like it, has most options I was looking for to help my time management and utilize time blocking Requests; 1: Whole Week View - I'm looking for healthy rhythm and repetition in my weekly routine as an independent worker, difficult to visualize when I can only view one day. 2: Sharing - I'd love to be able to share my routine with my wife through this app. Perhaps two ways to share; ""by whole routine,"" and ""by tag.""",positive
11765,Very nice app and easy to use. My only complaint is that I wish there was an option to have a weekly view in block format like a planner versus just the timeline. But it is still very convient to use the routines.,positive
11766,"Nothing like a to-do list, this is a power tool. Only one of its kind. With this I can eventually time my teeth brushing and even toilet visits to the minute. Definitely not a to-do list.",positive
11767,good and useful,positive
11768,I wish to buy the pro version and also encourage my friends and family to do the same but hope you can make some improvements to the app. The UI looks very minimal which is a vanilla android template for an app development. Please make the UI a bit more appealing. We would have also like to do routines that are repeated in intervals of more than 15 days. Present app doesn't allow me to set a monthly routine. Hope the icons can be more rich and appealing.,positive
11769,Its good for time management,positive
11770,not exactly what i needed,positive
11771,"Good organizer. This apps is lovely to look at and good for scheduling. It is more for idealized schedule as it does not really let you adjust during the day if something comes up. Overall, good.",positive
11772,add notebook page,positive
11773,This is a really useful app. Is this weekly scheduled repeat every week until I delete it?,positive
11774,good,positive
11775,"Great for maintaining and keeping a routine. This is detailed enough to develop any kind of daily/weekly/monthly routine, and flexible enough to incorporate out-of-routine events and distractions if you use it right. It is a bit tedious for some people, (that's why the 4 stars) but they can keep it simple and high-level if they like. But, if you really want to tame that beast called your work week, school agenda, or personal days like me, this will take care of it.",positive
11776,"pretty good, so i can set my life straight on my daily good habits and positive impacts of my self motivation",positive
11777,"How do I ""push back"" and/or ""bump up"" a daily routine? *Edit: They answered my issue. Other than needing an easier way to do what I mentioned above, I love this app. Very easy to use and very started. I love that you can create your own Tags too.",positive
11778,The app is great but the notifications are not working. Please do help with this issue.,positive
11779,"i love rhat there ia a wodget on my acreen so i can always see which tasks i ahould be working on. Does the full version connect to your preferred calendar. i ahve been using my gmail calendar for years, hut i dont see where they sync up.",positive
11780,useful,positive
11781,I was supppeerrrr exited about the app and it was really good but one of my alarms I set wouldn't turn off unless I deleted the app.,positive
11782,this app seems awsome and it is just mabe a touch up on sound otherwise I love it! this is exactly what I needed,positive
11783,"very good. it is a bit complicated to use. It should probably have a tutorial or an expailnation about the different functions, as some of them just seem to be the same thing with just a differeent look. (i could just be stupid, which is a possibility).",positive
11784,good app,positive
11785,I like the simplicity of this app. It deserves 5 stars if other features is free.,positive
11786,"This app is the best to schedule my day! Further more, here are some possible features to add! ; a homework option w/ reminder, water reminder, mood tracker, monthly routine, and calendar? Also would like if premium was cheaper :(",positive
11787,This is a great app to manage schedule. interface and otherthings are perfect. But I wish that the on-screen notification should be like the lock screen popup notification.,positive
11788,"Really good and super helpful. Because of Covid-19, there's a chance I won't be going to school for a couple months and I wanted an easy to follow routine to factor in my online courses for a minimum of 2 hours. Didn't do just that, but I was actually able to fit in all my chores with more than enough free time to spare. I really recommend the app, and will definitely be telling my friends!",positive
11789,Best! But bringing menu bar from side to below Was a big mistake! Bc there is ad bar and then there is menu bar! So its like half of the screen is gone and its so ugly! (Ik ad bar will be gone if we pay) I had to downgrade to 2.7.1 to fix it.. Plz bring back menu bar to where it was so that i can update,positive
11790,"I just downloaded this app and I can tell that it's very useful and user freindly, I used other apps to organize myself but this one takes the cake and on top of that the developers/owner of this app responds to issues or suggested features unlike other apps I've used, that's the main reason I think this app is great",positive
11791,"Have you heard of that saying, ""Where did the time go""? Well this app helps me stay on schedule with my day instead of it just disappearing with nothing accomplished. Love the interface and very user friendly.",positive
11792,I have tried many time managing apps and I like this one the most!,positive
11793,Great app! Helped me get my time optimized and scheduled. Thank you very much developers!(1 suggestion would be to add auto backup on the cloud through google and so on),positive
11794,"No, what I mean is, in the past it wasnt ""day 1"" instead monday tuesday wednesday and etc, but I'm fine with it being this way, I can adapt to the problem quickly. Nice job, this apps is worth the price, been using it for 2 years",positive
11795,"Since I linked it with a smart watch I've been able to make the most out of everyday, which is huge since I used to do nothing due to indecision. I've scheduled time for both professional stuff, self-improvement and working through my backlog of movies and games. Super easy to use too, and good backup support (I switched phones and all my routines were imported). Solid app.",positive
11796,"Powerfull, easy to use, active blog, doing what promising even as free. Will give it a try and probably gonna buy. I ussually read negative reviews first, so small note - dont understant why people complaints about tutorial. Having it is beneficial. And frankly its quite good.",positive
11797,This app has really helped me organize my schedule and block out my routines that don't fit into other time blocks and have smaller increments of type that are hard to see in other calendar apps. I would recommend using for morning and evening routines.,positive
11798,"Its amazing for both daily routines and for events to put on a calendar and it's very intuitive, so no much n thead about it at all. Also being free it offers alot and more with prob but i use free only.",positive
11799,"Nice app... Good layout and design.. One request- Add tracking as well to the tasks.. then it will be complete solution Along with setting up tasks I need to track as well which tasks I have done today, weekwise and monthwise",positive
11800,If you are looking for a perfect organiser of your time. This is the app for you. Love it and you will too if you are like me and want some organisation in your life. Perfect!,positive
11801,The more I use this app the more I love it. I've been looking for something like this for a long time. One thing: I'd like to be able to sort my routines chronologically rather than alphabetically.,positive
11802,"Simple yet effective app to manage daily and weekly schedules. A tad difficult to learn and setup, but once you get going it feels natural.",positive
11803,It's amazing! I've started to being more organized after using TimeTune. The best daily routine scheduler and reminder out there! 😊😊,positive
11804,Really really good at what it does. Great customization with a really lightweight interface. I can't wait to see where it goes.,positive
11805,"Love this app, really wanted something to block plan my day, it is flexible, you can make your own tags and events are automatically imported from calendar",positive
11806,This app os great for planning out your days. Its helped me become more effective at aticking to a plan. The customer service is very quick and helpful!,positive
11807,"The app has great routine planner, helps me keep organized! It's important to me for someone with ADHD!",positive
11808,Great app to keep your timing steady.,positive
11809,This app is just perfect. It helped me to manage my time so that I didn't waste any of my time. I highly recommend it to others,positive

I was amazed to see that I had more than 40 hours available a week whereas I thought I didn’t have enough time in my life. I strongly recommend to those who wants to get the blessings of a routine. And I suggest the developers that if you can bring a option to view the routine in a printable weekly calendar that would be better. Thanks",positive

11826,It's one of the best time management app... Just love it.,positive
11827,"Absolutely fallen in love with this app! Time management is my biggest struggle with ADHD, and the idle notifications reminding me of what I should be doing and what is coming up soon are quickly becoming essential. Hoping the developers will take the statistics of how much time is spent on each tag that's currently in only routines to the tag page as well, for daily and weekly.",positive
11828,"● 2019-10-15 EDIT: Just wanted to update my previous reviews to say that the problem I initially encountered seems to have gone away. I don't know exactly when, or how (maybe thanks to an automatic update of the app itself or Android), but TimeTune notifications now happen reliably and on time, just as you would expect, so I'm now upgrading my initial 4 stars to 5 stars—big thanks to the devs! ● 2018-11-05 EDIT: Already in touch with support and testing. After restarting my device it appears to be working, but I will need to test for a few days before I can confirm ● INITIAL REVIEW: App itself is great, but Android keeps closing it after a few minutes of inactivity. As a result, notifications don't happen. I've followed the troubleshooting steps which I was already familiar with and have worked for other apps. just not for TimeTune. I wish I could fix this, it's such a great app!",positive
11829,"This app is exactly what I was searching for. Tried many productivity apps, but this the ideal app for that purpose. It lets you plan your whole day as a schedule and lets you repeat the schedule as a custom routine. Lots of other tools and customizations. Best for procrastinators (like me) and for students who are preparing for exams.",positive
11830,"I've only been using this app for a week so take this with a gain of salt. I've never been someone who could stick to a routine. This app is great because I can configure it to get in my face about what I'm supposed to be doing. The pop-up, the voice notification, the persistent icon in my status bar work together to get my lazy butt on track.",positive

11832,"I love this app, it is really useful in order to keep a schedule. Still I was wondering if it is possible to add tasks alone of the schedule grid and then choose the day to add it. This will make easier to define the tasks yo wanna meet and then sort them along the week, or add unexpected events to modify a full day schedule.",positive
11833,The best time managing app + easy to use,positive
11834,"This app is amazing. I've always liked to create schedules to better plan my day but using other apps haven't worked out for me. This app however is absolutely fantastic, I love the fact that you can create your own tags for each subject and set events with reminders. Good work!",positive

11845,The app is just what I wanted! But I'd be so glad if there's a feature to move all the routine events in time equally. Like if you wake 30 mins late you can move all of the events 30 mins upwards,positive

12182,Used it until simple backup was premiumized. Restore wont work between different versions unless you modi-hack the file. Author would not tell you that you can do it though if you ask his help ! . Restore dont recognize my backup file at all so all my lists are basically inaccessible now. Will never install this again and I suggest anyone who values his data not to !,negative
12183,Too complicated and time consuming to set a task. No way to repeat on a monthly basis and specific day of the week at the same time. Not worth the time it takes to use it. Uninstalling.,negative
12184,"Definitely I appropriate your hard work and this app different from all those big guys apps, but question is if someone lost the phone or uninstalled the app, what is the purpose this app?, So i'm just suggesting, > you can limit the how many task can be added by users without premium >Opt.

12190,Scheduling reminder intervals does not work!!!!,negative
12191,I remember the days when you bought an app and owned it.. Now every developer wants to lock you into a lifetime subscription process where they can charge you for eternity. I simply refuse to rent my own notepad.,negative

12196,"Yes, I started with a 3 star review, but I did drop it down to a 1 star review. Why? The developed asked me to send a screenshot of a spontaneous mismatch between what I typed and what the app accepted as my task.

12204,"Dear developers, thank you for deleting all my reminders after updating the app! It was not pleasant at all, believe me!",negative
12205,"I do not like the functionality of the app. I found it is very easy to delete a sub list. But if you create a second list I could not figure out how to delete it after going through all settings. I also did not like the fact that you can only add one item within the sub list.

12206,Recurrent tasks don't work,negative
12207,"Used to work ok, now, something is skrewy. Now, if I restart my phone, EVERY SINGLE task comes up as a notification, never mind of when the tasks were/are due, and the schedule I set. Now, after I dismiss tasks, they pop up again, ignoring its schedule. Also, wish app could remember which day the task is for. If you have a daily task that you complete after midnight, it thinks you completed it early and won't remind you later that day. Finally, wish app opened to an overview of all lists.",negative
12208,I just removed this app! I missed several events in the last couple of months because it did not notify me!!!!!,negative
12209,"after few months it started not checking the task.

12212,"at the beginning was good but i wait two months later and the app keep putting back as not done reminders that i mark as done already and the other task that have date and mark as priority don't even showed me, if you can fix that ill stay with the app otherwise i will keep looking... sadly the only remid app that work good was the apple one but i don't have iphone anymore so? came on please make this one work",negative

12546,"App is good, have lot of features, but I would suggest one basic thing that needs to be changed. In ""Tasks"" app the menu can be reached by pressing the title icon. Also to change the list we have to press the icon on top left corner of widget. It is different (and little disturbing) from normal process we are following since many years. Please try to change the menu button on widget to the top left icon. Thanks",neutral

12548,"Is it true that non-premium version soon will loose any way for backup/restore or transfer to another phone? If not true: Please point to me what is the backup/restore way that stays in app in the future. Thanks a lot!. If true: That is really bad news - backup is a basic necessity, so non-premium version will become practically useless on the long term. In addition, premium costs twice as much for a single year than, let's say OsmAnd+ for eternity. And that is a much more complex app + the free version is completely usable within reasonable limits. Tasks is a really nice app (except that swichingt between sublists/lists is unreasonably slow) with some unique and essential features. But this wracks it, it will drive me away. Possibly others too. Not a fair move to reduce base functionality like that. RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGE'S RESPONSE: That is fair enough, except for one important detail: all the people using your free app are now forced to decide - if they want to have a meaningful app - to pay or search for another app. Premium app should only add features and not restrict free app's capabilities. If you add worthwhile features with a fair pricing, people will buy it. Lots of people spent time to set up their tasking system because the app had the right properties for them, now it looks like they were lured into using the app and then forcing them to pay. I payed for a number of apps (all cheaper than yours btw.), and actually my plan was to pay/donate as soon as the slowness of switching between task lists disappear, because I thought the app is really useful and it deserves support. This change is different. I do not mean you should not ask for payment for cloud backup etc., just that you should not remove the free local backup (or any other feature). Or that you should have omitted it from the free version from the start. Best wishes! RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGE'S SECOND RESPONSE: Actually you can clearly see from my review that I do not want everything for free. My problem is different. If we could not understand each other so far, perhaps it's not worth trying any more. So I won't comment on the rest of your answer. All the best!",neutral

When creating a repeat, there is no way to set it to do a certain day of the month (ie: the 3rd Saturday of the month, or the Last Sunday of the month).

12754,"Is it true that non-premium version soon will loose any way for backup/restore or transfer to another phone? If not true: Please point to me what is the backup/restore way that stays in app in the future. Thanks a lot!. If true: That is really bad news - backup is a basic necessity, so non-premium version will become practically useless on the long term. In addition, premium costs twice as much for a single year than, let's say OsmAnd+ for eternity. And that is a much more complex app + the free version is completely usable within reasonable limits. Tasks is a really nice app (except that swichingt between sublists/lists is unreasonably slow) with some unique and essential features. But this wracks it, it will drive me away. Possibly others too. Not a fair move to reduce base functionality like that. RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGE'S RESPONSE: That is fair enough, except for one important detail: all the people using your free app are now forced to decide - if they want to have a meaningful app - to pay or search for another app. Premium app should only add features and not restrict free app's capabilities. If you add worthwhile features with a fair pricing, people will buy it. Lots of people spent time to set up their tasking system because the app had the right properties for them, now it looks like they were lured into using the app and then forcing them to pay. I payed for a number of apps (all cheaper than yours btw.), and actually my plan was to pay/donate as soon as the slowness of switching between task lists disappear, because I thought the app is really useful and it deserves support. This change is different. I do not mean you should not ask for payment for cloud backup etc., just that you should not remove the free local backup (or any other feature). Or that you should have omitted it from the free version from the start. Best wishes! RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGE'S SECOND RESPONSE: Actually you can clearly see from my review that I do not want everything for free. My problem is different. If we could not understand each other so far, perhaps it's not worth trying any more. So I won't comment on the rest of your answer. All the best!",neutral

12846,"This app has great potential but is not there yet. Example, if a task repeats but without notification, then you manually mark it completed. The task is shown as completed & should advance to the next scheduled date. Instead it is showing up the next day as past due. But, if the task repeats with notification, then on the due date/time the system instantly advances the due date but does not show the task as completed so you have no record of the task due today & I have overlooked many. Not good!",neutral

12848,"like to check off sub-task via widget without opening app. (checking off task without subtasks works fine). Wish widget showed calendar. Wish app had daily, weekly, monthly, yearly trends, wish app to sync to google calendar.

12850,Notification is not of up to my expectation. Need to keep on reminding us until we check or tick it... Besides that.. The way of organizing the tasks and prioritizing them are perfect. I do love to continue using it if they update the notification part.,neutral
12851,"Great job on the app, for improvements sake - I would make the lists have a font size option, or something where if the 'items' in the to do list are more than a few words, they can look more organized, given that the square resides in the middle of the 'to do item', to me they seem a bit crammed together",neutral

Got a new phone and everything transferred but because this app doesn't have you log in, everything is gone. I had several important lists saved to prepare for my upcoming baby and it's all gone. I'll never remember it all. Time to look for something else to use. Response: From the main screen I didn't see any prompting so did not know I was supposed to or how to.",neutral

12858,very useful and simple. nothing too fancy but still fun no complicated features. i love the multiple lists options and sub category lists. only glitch i find is returning to previous pages after typing...often i have to just hit my home button and navigate all the way back to where i was...but nothing too bad.,neutral

12868,"Hi Stephen, I was getting used to using this instead of the late Inbox Reminders but some repeat reminders just aren't coming up anymore. high reviews and great until it wasn't great. There should be an option to make recurring task reminders to not have ""due dates"". It should come up and I can clear it without removing the reminder from showing up due to needing to move out the due date. Can there be just an option to make a task not have a due date and make it recurring every so often? Thanks!",neutral
12869,"If all you want is to make lists or be reminded of something once, then this is a great app. BUT if you want a reoccurring reminder....forget it. It won't recreate the reminder for the next occurrence once you complete the first occurrence.",neutral
12870,"One of the billions of to-do lists app. Nothing special. Unpredictable non-intuitive behavior, as usual. Useless hints for features, that are obvious. I've thrown this app away after the third time, when I accidentally removed my task while simply scrolling the list.",neutral

They had been working fine, then for no reason that I can find, they stopped. I've tried reinstalling the app, but this didn't fix it. I am getting a reminder at the time my tasks are set for (or 3 - 4 minutes late) though.

12894,ok. its useful,neutral
12895,The creating of tasks is pretty straightforward and easy to use but I don't like the idea that tasks in filters are the same copy of tasks in lists. Sometimes I change my mind with which tasks and lists go to which filters and if I want to remove the filter then it deletes all the tasks within it as well. I want to be able to delete the filter without having to delete the tasks themselves entirely.,neutral

two, none did the latter two. This one. It does let me add notes but sadly 
does not make the notification sound when the phone is on silent which is a

Edit: Showing the calendar view in a widget would be fantastic as well.",positive
12949,Great task and project management app. User friendly and versatile. Lists and sub lists work well for most to do list requirements. Would just recommend to developers to introduce a couple of improvements... 1) there should be a difference between the date you plan to do a task and its deadline/due date. 2) would be great to be able to add a description and deadline to a sub list thereby creating little projects.,positive
12950,"I really liked this app, however I have downloaded it yesterday and created tasks which repeats daily but it always shows tasks date 30 March.

Even in the calander view these tasks are not added to 31 March. It's annoying me. Please do something about it.",positive
12951,"I wish I could give it 5 stars. Only thing missing is a Windows/Linux app for syncing, which I can't do without, and that's the only thing keeping me away.

12953,"Tasks:ToDo is a work in progress. Nevertheless, it is very handy, and I am happy to have it. (I'm a former Wunderlist user.) I believe the app developer will continue to tweak Tasks: ToDo. Not that it's not helpful now. I do miss the deleted items not being ""hidden"" under the category of tasks they came from.

12956,To do list works good but it is no idiot proof. Developer needs to add more walk through instructions at start when the app is downloaded. When people commit on issues- the developer replies offended- but the developer did not make a idiot proof way of solving these problems that a newbie with little patience would have- instead they lash out - its not the user's fault- its the developer fault for not understanding the concept of idiot proofing a sound product- face it-people don't read!,positive
12957,Good app. Effective at reminders. Easy to use and read. Looked at quite a few task apps. Happy i picked this.,positive
12958,Definitely helps me to stay organized a little easier. I personally use it in conjunction with an old fashioned pen and paper when I have a lot to get done in a day. The only complaint I have with it is that I wish I could add additional reminders for the tasks instead of having to choose a reminder time based off of a due date I set. Other than that it's great and easy to use.,positive

12961,"For some reason I can't edit my other review on the phone, or if I can it's not clear how. Lists are not in an intuitive place imo, so I missed them entirely, resulting in that erroneous post.

When you cross of an item it doesn't show up in the widget and when you edit the list in app, it doesn't update on the widget. According to the dev it's Xiaomi's fault, which I think is a possibility so be aware of this when you download it.",positive
12965,"I like the app but there is one thing that annoys the hell out of me. I use a number of sublists for shopping. Whenever the screen changes orientation or Auto rotates the app defaults back to the first sub list and I have to reopen the one I was working with. Very annoying.

Maybe find a new hobby if you don't like comments.",positive
12966,"Super great app. Just installed and l feel already familiar with. Two comments: It would be great to have the possibility to change time setting with digital clock and not only timepiece visual. Second, having the possibility to set a reminder based on the location, not only time, as proposed by other ""To Do"" applications. Otherwise, the App is looks really great. Congrats to the developers.",positive
12967,Just what i needed. I especially love the subtasks function. The only suggestion is to make the layout more compact. I set up tasks on a calender using another app and they use similar fields but have a smaller popup window for setup. I love your color design much better and it makes me want to open the app and update regularly,positive
12968,"I really loved this app. It has everything I wanted. But I feel like there is still room for improvement in this app, it's my personal opinion though, It will be better if you could add a screen for the heat map and that heat map would be colored on the days when user did at least one task, another one could be letting user add notes for subtasks also. 🙏",positive
12969,"I'm loving it so far. It is clean, user-friendly and v simple to use. Not too much drama that I have to sort out - I don't need background landscape pictures for example and I don't need graphs and charts to rate my productivity. I just need to get stuff done. Thanks Guys!",positive

12974,"It's not as straight forward as others. But I like the many color options I have a task that is a grocery list, so it is lengthy. In moving from list to list I have accidentally removed items. I don't see an undo.",positive
12975,This app is great to organize your day or make shopping lists etc. But sadly I don't get notifications even if I turned them on. I hope this will be fixed soon!,positive
12976,"Love it!! Only wish there was more instruction on how it all works! It does alot, will be perfect, once I learn how it's all done 😄!!",positive
12977,Fantastic except I cant attach photos to a task. A picture is worth a thousand words. Otherwise it's the best app for lists. Keeping work and home seperate ect.,positive
12978,"Very easy to use and intuitive. Wish there were a way to roll incomplete tasks forward to a new list or a different list (I tend to make a list for each day). Otherwise, love it.",positive

12984,Useful app In my opinion what can make your app a 5 star is add parsonalized image to tasks and possebility to make predefined tasks that you can add them to any list and global research you can find any task in all lists. Thank you for replying to my comment,positive
12985,"Great app, would love customizable notifications and icons. That being said, of course this is a hobby project, just being wishful. Meant no offense. I'd love to reach out, it's always nice to get in touch with a fellow developer",positive
12986,I have only been using the app for a short period of time. So far it has been a great tool. The Bility to addnsubtask to a task is very helpful. Great job.,positive
12987,I'd give this a five star if not for the backing up which prevents importing mismatched versions. Kinda redundant if we can't use the backup that we took two weeks prior.,positive
12988,"I really like it, easy to use. Just wish it would remind me again after the time has elapsed without having to reset the time for the task. Other than that, it's great.",positive
12989,"This is the best task keeping app out on the market. It has a very easy interface, and many useful features that are blended together well into a useful product.",positive
12990,Does the basics clearly and easily. I particularly like that it allows you to sort completed tasks in alphabetical order (some other apps don't),positive
12991,Absolutely a great App. It helps my family to keep track on our activities and also for my work. Nice design and very practical,positive
12992,So far it's been very helpful & useful for simple lists like groceries & things I need to remember to pick up for my daughter.,positive
12993,Although it's very helpful but make a navbar of all the lists or try to show all the lists in list format when we open the app so that we can see which lists are there,positive
12994,"Working great for me. Simple to use, relatively detailled, free... !",positive
12995,"Will there ever be an update with an easier way to sync with other devices? I have spent so much time trying out todo apps with reminders and this is probably the best one ever, but I would really want to be able to manage it all across more than one device, such as with an autimatic periodic upload or one-touch sync button like in colornote. Thanks",positive
12996,I love this app. What I liked is the alarm feature for individual list items.,positive
12997,Its a very good app however I guess its desktop version is not available. If they have it will be a great organizing app. Great app 😘,positive
12998,It's useful simple to use Have lot of features but not complicated and disturbing Maybe it's not number #1 but I'm sure it's one the best apps,positive
12999,"Great distillation point for my mind maps, app is very simple interface to a reasonable amount of credible task tracking functionality",positive
13000,Like it. Colors. Change order. Multiple list. Completing date.,positive
13001,I love the basic version. It really helps me stay organized!,positive
13002,Helpful to keep track of to do's and can set reminders at various times.,positive
13003,Perhaps add option to set task list as homepage. Rest is good so far.,positive
13004,So quick and handy. A proper list app with no annoying features,positive
13005,"Good, could be better I can not find where you can have a task repeat every week, month, year",positive
13006,Really like this app especially when I can categorise the different reminders.,positive
13007,Easy to use. Really helps keeping me on top of things.,positive
13008,Great app. Only one disadvantage : no backup possible.,positive
13009,A great way to get organized and remember your to-do list!,positive
13010,Love it makes sures I do my task one thing to fix can you make a section where we can save our list in case we get new phones,positive
13011,"The app is real comfortable for use, the only thing I can't understand is how to view the events you create from the calendar icon top left?",positive
13012,Could you write an option so we can backup lists to cloud? Otherwise this app is really handy.,positive
13013,"Keeps me on top of work jobs, home jobs and family. Would be 5 if I could pin the list to my home screen, which I have tried to find a way of doing but cant seem to",positive
13014,Very useful very easy to use.,positive
13015,"Extremely helpful app!! Helps me be very organized. I used to make paper lists, but I would lose them. This allows me to keep my to do lists in one place and is very easy to add tasks. I would like to see a feature where you can populate it daily/weekly/monthly . (ex. Morning routine daily, Vacuum weekly, mail out the electric bill monthly)",positive
13016,"This app is so good, it organized my life, but the reminder does not work",positive
13017,Can construct reminders well with an in depth layout,positive
13018,"I LOVE this app. It's perfect for making a variety of different lists and tasks and ""to dos"". I like how simple and straight forward it is and how you can easily colour coordinate or specify each task with labels and reminders. The only reason why its not a 5 star is because it would be very great to have a grocery shopping specific list you could create that had the option to order foods in different food groups or store categories ie dairy, veggies, meats etc. Thank you!",positive
13019,"The only bad point is I can't tick the sub task box on the widget, and this is quite disappointing.",positive
13020,"App is great, it's simple enough to use. What would be great is the ability to add in a password protect function for any notes you enter in. Also 1 thing that annoys me (hence the 3stars) is that I find more often than not that when I type words, the preview screen truncates the first 2-3 letters and replaces them with dots. ** Developer very quick responding to feedback =)",positive
13021,"You have to pay to pay monthly sync across devices, it should be a one time cost. Edit - You know what streve, I was greedy, everthing else is free. but interdevice sync is a standard in most apps, so the lack of the option is a real down side and now I have to switch app, and it's not that I'm not willing to pay. I just want it to be a one time cost and I still won't pay the price for your years subscription even if it was for a lifetime of use. So I'll give you 4 stars but leave the app.",positive
13022,"Very good tool to use. One suggested feature for future development: it would be helpful if an already set task could be dragged as a sub task for another already set task. When reordering tasks by dragging them, if the task is dragged over an existing task, it should automatically become a sub task there. The reverse should also be available, to drag out a sub task by taking it in between two tasks.",positive
13023,"So far so good, app is great. Helps me mostly keep track of what I need to do, not make sure I do it. make it more aggressive. Wish it had a daily reminder that would just pop up to remind me of all my most recent tasks at the start of the day that i could dismiss, just to remind me. So I dont have to wait for each task to remind me on or before the due date. Also when a task is completed it seems to keep reminding me in pop up until I go to the task and scroll to the completed button.",positive
13024,Great but confusing when starting ro to use it,positive
13025,"I have been looking for a well done app that has checklists that allow sublists... This app is well organized and easy to understand how to use. I do have a couple future feature additions I would like to see, that I will send to the developer. But I am quite happy with this app!",positive
13026,"it is good I like being able to add sub task lists for each task and categorise each. I would really like if there was a pre-made to do today/ tasks I want to focus on category that one comes up as soon as you open the app like a front page + visible calendar 30 day layout one can schedule tasks to, making it easier to plan out tasks systemically",positive
13027,"It's sadly evident that most to-do list apps are created by people with remarkably little to do. This is a delightful rare exception. Logical, simple but powerful, with all the basic necessities covered and good customization options, this is the closest mobile equivalent to AbstractSpoon's ToDoList available. Edit: Removing one star for the total removal of local backup. Monetization is understandable and deserved, but removal of a simple local failsafe to push (Premium) cloud backup reeks.",positive
13028,I love that I can check things off as I do them throughout the day and not the next day they reset so I can go to the list again without repeatingly putting them in the only thing I wish is either I could send the results daily to my calendar preferably automatically but at least manually or the app kept a history so I could tell how often I completed my goals. Love snooze option too,positive
13029,"It's a great app. You can search for words in tasks. The reminders show up on my new Samsung S10, which is why I had to ditch Keep. To get five stars, I would like to see an easy way to access the app on my desktop. It would be great if it would work with Google calendar.",positive
13030,Very Helpful! I can see what I have accomplished and organize my week with what I want to do.,positive
13031,Good experience it's very easy And helpful!,positive
13032,Very good app. Simple to use.,positive
13033,This app helps me keep track of my daily tasks at work,positive
13034,"Very helpful to keep me on task with work, home, life.",positive
13035,For a hobby project as described by the author it is a job very well done. I don't have any complaints. May be upgrading the UX (not the UI) a little bit would make it an excellent experience for the end user.,positive
13036,Stuck in lists screen but none of my lists are showing and the only option is to add a new list. What am I doing wrong? (BTW- I love what I've seen so far. Being able to add sub tasks under sub tasks? Awesome! 5th star awaits...,positive
13037,"So far so good, simple and functional. Would like an easy way to quickly move items from one list to another as I shift things from a general todo list to a today list each morning. Clear clean and ad free. Love it.",positive
13038,Works very well and is easy to Use.,positive
13039,Highly recommended. My only complaint is that the interface could use a little improvement as far as navigation and calendar access. Otherwise I LOVE that lists are completely customizable.,positive
13040,"Easy to use. Flexible. I use the sub list feature to describe steps needed to accomplish a task. I have lists for every day of the week. Some tasks need to be done each day, e.g. wash dishes, etc. Some tasks are unique and I create them as needed. For each day I have 'to do' and 'done' sections. Once a task is completed it goes to the done section. This app helps me focus on getting things done and has become an essential part of my daily routine.",positive
13041,"I've been using the app for a few weeks and I love it. I didn't give it 5 stars because sometimes I get a notification that a task is due, before the notification day/time I set. Other than that, no complaints.",positive
13042,"I'm using this app for all my recurring reminders that I need to remember that I don't actually want on my To Do list (like fill up water bottle, remind kids to pack their lunches, etc). I've tried several apps; the reason I've settled on this one for those reminders is b/c it will give me a reminder notification EVERY time whether or not I completed it last time. I LOVE that you can select specific days of the week (not just weekly or daily). My biggest concern is it not having cloud backup.",positive
13043,Hi! So I was supposed to be rating this perfect but I want this app to be improved because I love it so much! It's so small yet compact. I love it. My problem is it doesn't have a backup option. Like a sync thing that I can do it on my Google account. I hope you guys have that option the same with other note apps. Thanks a lot!,positive
13044,"I've been using rhis app for a few weeks. I have a Pixel 2 XL. Pros: Great app. User friendly. Easy to use & group tasks. I love that you can rearrange tasks bases on your preference. Im an entrepreneur with many projecrs and it def keeps me on track. Cons: I wish it could track the amount of time I spend on each major task & sub task, like a time clock. Is this a possibility in Q1 or Q2 of 2020?",positive
13045,"Almost perfect, the only thing I wish was different is I wish all my lists were available on a main screen & that they were clickable from there. I don't like that it stays on one list instead of a homescreen instead where all lists available at a quick glance instead of having to go & open the tab to see the lists. I'd use it a lot more that way.",positive
13046,i would add notes to subtasks,positive
13047,Easy and usefully and helpfully,positive
13048,Easy and simple to use.,positive
13049,"First of all very nice app! I do however have one problem and a suggestion: the filtered list. Can you add conditions based on how frequently the tasks are repeated? I really want to see my tasks filtered to today, tomorrow, and weekly task lists. Hoping for your feedback, Z",positive
13050,Great but confusing when starting ro to use it,positive
13051,"Great app so far, very user friendly. Would love an option to duplicate a hole list (found an option to duplicate sub-list only). Thanks!",positive
13052,Great task and project management app. User friendly and versatile. Lists and sub lists work well for most to do list requirements. Would just recommend to developers to introduce a couple of improvements... 1) there should be a difference between the date you plan to do a task and its deadline/due date. 2) would be great to be able to add a description and deadline to a sub list thereby creating little projects.,positive
13053,Works great at keeping me organized. I have not had it long so I will have to explore the features. Update-New phone. I can now use the microphone to add tasks. This app is just smart enough. I use it as my own personal to do list separate from Google Tasks which I use for work. It's simple with just enough features and not all the predictive noise threaded through all Google apps.,positive
13054,"Haven't come across a better app if it's type. It's not a project management tool but you can have a list in your reminder! It's probably a big leap but if i could share the task list with somebody without exporting that would be cool. The notification, repeat, export control, is brilliant. Really helps me organise my home tasks without being frustratingly intrusive and distracting. I've tried a lot of applications, this is second to none!",positive
13055,Very useful very easy to use.,positive
13056,It helps me organize my life.,positive
13057,Very useful and easy to use.,positive
13058,"I wish I could give it 5 stars. Only thing missing is a Windows/Linux app for syncing, which I can't do without, and that's the only thing keeping me away. I would happily pay for that feature. If you just need an Android app, no need to look elsewhere. It has everything you can ask for. The UI is great, and very intuitive.",positive
13059,This is a really useful app for managing multiple to do lists.,positive
13060,Good app. Effective at reminders. Easy to use and read. Looked at quite a few task apps. Happy i picked this.,positive
13061,I have reminder set for every weekday morning at a certain time. Hasn't reminded me at the right time yet. Always hours after I get it.,positive
13062,Very good app. Simple to use.,positive
13063,Like it!,positive
13064,"I really liked this app, however I have downloaded it yesterday and created tasks which repeats daily but it always shows tasks date 30 March. It was just the date I created it, it repeats daily so the dates should change too. It feels as if I am checking undone tasks from the past. Even in the calander view these tasks are not added to 31 March. It's annoying me. Please do something about it.",positive
13065,Not a very userfriendly app. But you'll figure it out,positive
13066,"So far I am enjoying this task app. I am still learning new things, but is definitely helping me stay organized.",positive
13067,"It would be better if we can insert pictures in the tasks. But all in all, it was cute and helpful!",positive
13068,Easy interface 😁,positive
13069,So far so good. I just need to remember to look at it.,positive
13070,Good,positive
13071,"Tasks:ToDo is a work in progress. Nevertheless, it is very handy, and I am happy to have it. (I'm a former Wunderlist user.) I believe the app developer will continue to tweak Tasks: ToDo. Not that it's not helpful now. I do miss the deleted items not being ""hidden"" under the category of tasks they came from. This was very handy for shopping (especially groceries & other places I shop for), I could peruse my completed list for things I may have forgotten. Thanks so much! Continue the good work",positive
13072,"Love it, best i could find so far",positive
13073,Lets me make nice lists for everything!,positive
13074,A little confusing to navigate at first but otherwise useful,positive
13075,"Really, just started using this app. Seems pretty good but way early days to rate beyond 4* even if it does deserve it.",positive
13076,This sponsors exactly what you want it to do. Also love the colours and reminder options.,positive
13077,"Good, could be better I can not find where you can have a task repeat every week, month, year",positive
13078,Such an easy to use task manager,positive
13079,Best task app I've found with reminders and a variety of tasks types. Keep up the good work.,positive
13080,"This app looks great and most of the functions seem to be very practical. There isn't any Windows or browser-based version for usage on a computer, is it? If not, is something in planning? As Wunderlist will be shut down, I'm in search for a good alternative, and this app WITH a sync function would be amazing! Edit: Showing the calendar view in a widget would be fantastic as well.",positive
13081,Just what I need,positive
13082,"I like: * the way it separates lists (""sub lists"") horizontally, and I can switch between them conveniently with swipes, though I tend to accidentally delete tasks when trying to switch lists * I value the convenience of swipe to delete the most * being able to quick add tasks from the main screen, removes one extra tap step * being able to highlight important tasks, but wish it would automatically pin them to the top. Feature I wish most for: Image attachments. Idea: Location-based reminders?",positive
13083,"I have looked and looked for an app that would let me make lists and check them off like pen and paper, and this does that. Simple and great to use.",positive
13084,"I am just beginning to use this app, but it appears to have everything I need",positive
13085,Good app,positive
13086,Fantastic except I cant attach photos to a task. A picture is worth a thousand words. Otherwise it's the best app for lists. Keeping work and home seperate ect.,positive
13087,Easy to use,positive
13088,This app is great to organize your day or make shopping lists etc. But sadly I don't get notifications even if I turned them on. I hope this will be fixed soon!,positive
13089,To do list works good but it is no idiot proof. Developer needs to add more walk through instructions at start when the app is downloaded. When people commit on issues- the developer replies offended- but the developer did not make a idiot proof way of solving these problems that a newbie with little patience would have- instead they lash out - its not the user's fault- its the developer fault for not understanding the concept of idiot proofing a sound product- face it-people don't read!,positive
13090,Easy to use. Really helps keeping me on top of things.,positive
13091,"Working great for me. Simple to use, relatively detailled, free... !",positive
13092,Pretty useful,positive
13093,"For some reason I can't edit my other review on the phone, or if I can it's not clear how. Lists are not in an intuitive place imo, so I missed them entirely, resulting in that erroneous post. If this supported arbitrarily nested task levels I'd give it five stars, but I'm definitely going to use this. R.I.P. Wunderlist",positive
13094,Can construct reminders well with an in depth layout,positive
13095,Great app,positive
13096,"Love it!! Only wish there was more instruction on how it all works! It does alot, will be perfect, once I learn how it's all done 😄!!",positive
13097,Just started using and so far it's good,positive
13098,Definitely helps me to stay organized a little easier. I personally use it in conjunction with an old fashioned pen and paper when I have a lot to get done in a day. The only complaint I have with it is that I wish I could add additional reminders for the tasks instead of having to choose a reminder time based off of a due date I set. Other than that it's great and easy to use.,positive
13099,Need compatible with apple for 5 star,positive
13100,Good,positive
13101,Its a very good app however I guess its desktop version is not available. If they have it will be a great organizing app. Great app 😘,positive
13102,Good,positive
13103,I love the different colour options 👏😍,positive
13104,"It's a good app for task reminder but it still needs some thing more. One needs to go into the menu to switch to the lists no matter which list has an upcoming task. It should have option to show the mix of tasks from all lists in tiles/widgets on app home interface. I really like the snooze option, quite straight away.",positive
13105,Helps me keep on track of what needs done.,positive
13106,Does what I need it to do,positive
13107,"Thanks for the response. The fact that an event repeats should have nothing to do with the type of notification and I think there should still be a repeating icon if no notification is set. It is possible to want an event to repeat without getting an alert. Also, why is the default ""notification"" when there is a date? All tasks with dates do not require a notification.",positive
13108,Only been using couple days. So far so good. Easy to get the hang of. Some functionality aspects could be enhanced but overall v glad to be with this app.,positive
13109,Simple to use and track tasks,positive
13110,Helpful in making list of work,positive
13111,"It's easy, smooth and fast.",positive
13112,A great way to get organized and remember your to-do list!,positive
13113,"Bullet should be in front of the first line of the paragraph, not in front of the middle of the paragraph",positive
13114,"I really loved this app. It has everything I wanted. But I feel like there is still room for improvement in this app, it's my personal opinion though, It will be better if you could add a screen for the heat map and that heat map would be colored on the days when user did at least one task, another one could be letting user add notes for subtasks also. 🙏",positive
13115,I love the basic version. It really helps me stay organized!,positive
13116,"Works as advertised, now it's up to you to finish it.",positive
13117,I love this app. What I liked is the alarm feature for individual list items.,positive
13118,Very Helpful! I can see what I have accomplished and organize my week with what I want to do.,positive
13119,"This app is so good, it organized my life, but the reminder does not work",positive
13120,Great,positive
13121,"It's not as straight forward as others. But I like the many color options I have a task that is a grocery list, so it is lengthy. In moving from list to list I have accidentally removed items. I don't see an undo.",positive
13122,Clear and easy to use,positive
13123,Works very well and is easy to Use.,positive
13124,Like it. Colors. Change order. Multiple list. Completing date.,positive
13125,So far so good. I will rate better once I start realy utilizing the app. Thanks!,positive
13126,"This is the best task keeping app out on the market. It has a very easy interface, and many useful features that are blended together well into a useful product.",positive
13127,The Widget shows only 1 List Item. Is there any way to enable multiple lists viewing in Widget Mode.,positive
13128,Although it's very helpful but make a navbar of all the lists or try to show all the lists in list format when we open the app so that we can see which lists are there,positive

13130,It ia wonderful app,positive
13131,"Great, handy way to stay organized",positive
13132,I'd give this a five star if not for the backing up which prevents importing mismatched versions. Kinda redundant if we can't use the backup that we took two weeks prior.,positive
13133,"Very easy to use and intuitive. Wish there were a way to roll incomplete tasks forward to a new list or a different list (I tend to make a list for each day). Otherwise, love it.",positive
13134,Good easy to use,positive
13135,"My go to tasks app. Happy to finally see a premium payment because you deserve money for this thing, but immediately saddened that it's subscription only! I get why, but please add a one time payment option too for those of us who don't want to deal with such things.",positive
13136,Great app. Only one disadvantage : no backup possible.,positive
13137,Helpful to keep track of to do's and can set reminders at various times.,positive

13144,Amazing for organizing my life,positive
13145,"Great app, would love customizable notifications and icons. That being said, of course this is a hobby project, just being wishful. Meant no offense. I'd love to reach out, it's always nice to get in touch with a fellow developer",positive
13146,"This is the closest app I've found since my last upgrade & lost a similar app. Best thing about it, it's VERY user friendly & everythings right at my fingertips. I'm still getting used to it, but loving it so far! I have only one change I'd like to see. I love how I can change the arrangement in my lists, could you make it so I can change the arrangement of my catagories as well. Thank you & I hope I don't loose this one when it comes time to upgrade!",positive
13147,"I wondered about arranging the main tasks and just found the solution! Just needed to scroll to the bottom while in tasks. I cannot say enough.about how very helpful this app is! I have found so many different uses for this app! I am wondering about the amount of information that can be stored, etc. What would an upgrade include and how much would it cost?",positive
13148,"This app is great! BUT I am having one issue that is dragging me away to other apps I like less overall. My work lunch hour switches every week between 11:00am and 12:00pm. I wish there was a way I could have a task repeat ""every two weeks on weekdays"" so that I could have these 2 tasks auto rotate weeks. Is this possible in this app?",positive
13149,"I got Taks to replace Todoist. Later, I deleted Tasks and went back to Todoist. Still not happy, I brought back Tasks and now run both apps side by side on my phone. Perfect solution. Todoist carries the heavyweight must-do daily work load. I refer to it two, maybe three times a day. But Tasks is there to be fleet of foot and versatile - a quick list here, a few to dos there. Adding to and ticking off right throughout the day. That is my way. But Tasks would be a great stand-alone app too!",positive
13150,"The most user friendly to do list I've ever had, and I've tried a few! I love the colour coding of each list, the push notifications which you can snooze for various amounts of time are spot on. It's definitely worth trying this if you want to get organised with ease. Now I've been using it for a couple of weeks, I have one thing that would be useful, it would be even more awesome if the snooze options included something specific such as 'tomorrow 8am', 'tomorrow 6pm'. Still an amazing app!",positive
13151,"Easy to install very similar to wunderlist but much easier. Was a wunderlist user for over 5 years loved the app kept my finances on straight and narrow thank you for do this amazing list. Did not like the new microsoft office task list far to difficult to get let alone use. I don't have time to fiddle around on phone and this takes me straight to my lists. I also used wunderlist for shopping, planning events loads I am looking forward to using this app.",positive
13152,"This is, quite literally, an app that has helped me organize not only my personal but professional life. From planning out my work week and important projects, to listing out groceries, Tasks never disappoints. I've tried tons of different apps, but I always seem to come back to Tasks because it's so user friendly and has so much to offer. On top of that, customer support is AMAZING. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would.",positive
13153,"Love LOVE LOVE the app I love the colors. I love that I can change or edit my list. (I just found out ) I love that I can copy my list and make him into a sub list. I love that it has easy swipe to delete them. I love that I can have several lists under one sub list. I have several different notes, list apps and this one is by far number one! the best!",positive
13154,"I have been a Wunderlist user for years. When Wunderlist announced they were transferribg to a new platform, I started looking for options. I chose Tasks because of its high rating and it has lived up to its rating. It is very easy to use. Unfortunately, I could never get the Wunderlist download to save on my phone so I have had to reenter everything by hand. But it is doable.",positive
13155,"I use this for organizing my homework and it's very helpful!! 10/10 recommend. It's simple to use, it's pretty, and it has tons of features. My favorite is the sub tasks as it allows my to have a each subject as a task, and all the assignment in that subject as sub tasks. Thx for making this wonderful app! 👌🏼🔥",positive
13156,I like it because I can keep track of things I need to do. I like the highlighted color it's a good sky blue and it's easy to make lists. It feels good to complete a list that takes a long time to complete. It's good for making for later and good for getting things done I give it 5 stars,positive
13157,I never leave reviews but this app truly deserves it! Somewhat basic in design (which is very nice to use) and extremely helpful! Love the traffic light feature (most important come first) and the sub-tasks! If you're forgetful or have a lot of little to-dos this app would be so beneficial!,positive
13158,"Have had this app for about 2 weeks and I love it. My last app crashed terribly and did not recover, lost everything. This app is super-simple to use with the right mix and selection of tools. Will update my rating in time.",positive
13159,"This is exactly what I was looking for! Tried different Task apps but il Ike the layout and functionality and ease of use. I can create multiple tasks with multiple subtask so I can separate home, work, and play. Kudos on a well designed app!",positive
13160,Would be perfect if there was a calendar view. Update: it is the perfect app to manage my To-do lists for every aspect of my life. The ability to have sub-lists based on priorities and the calendar view make this app the best!,positive
13161,I love this app somedays i just want to be lazy and do nothing but this app helps me stay on top of my game. I use it dor monthly goals and everyday todo lists another good thing about this app is that you can set tiners for each thing to be completed definitly a 10 out of 10 app,positive
13162,"Love it! Lets you make multiple lists and lets you move items up and down to prioritize. Most useful out of several ""to-do list"" apps I've tried.",positive
13163,This is the best app I've ever used to boost my productivity and keep a good record of my completed and incomplete tasks. I'm just a little sad that it's only compatible with Android at the moment. Could you please make it compatible with IOS too? It'd be super helpful if you could!!,positive
13164,"Indeed this is probably to be the best tasks app on Google Play. Super flexible and user friendly and yet somehow simple at the same time. I love how the developer thought of, well, everything, you could need really. There is no desktop version yet to sync between computer and phone. I would love to be the first to know when it's ready, because when I am home (well all of us really thanks to the coronavirus at the moment) I prefer to open up my laptop to add tasks because it would be done faster that way. Thank you Stephen Nottage!",positive
13165,"It wasn't as intuitive as other organizational apps I've used but once I got the hang of it, wow. So many options to really get organized in a detailed way. I love it",positive
13166,"Good app to help keep track of multiple jobs. Can also create different to-do lists, e.g., one for home and one for work. Love it!",positive
13167,"Wonderful app and great customer service. This app has replaced 2 or 3 of my old apps. This is the most customizable list app I have found. Colors can change, tasks can be rearranged within a list, lists can be rearranged. Tasks don't need a due date or time, but can be assigned either, along with notifications or alarms if desired. I had a small issue with sound, emailed support, problem solved in just a few days. Excellent!",positive
13168,"Thanks Stephen!! Great app. I'm naturally scattered and fast paced, and this app helps ensure nothing falls through the cracks.",positive
13169,This is everything I ever wanted out of a app without all the headaches and frustration and learning curve. If could have built an app for this project for work you would have been this exact same app. I always of some grand idea of what I want and can never find something quite right and end up very disappointed. It becomes too difficult to figure out how to use the program or its just too simple and not professional enough. You nailed it with this app and made Excel look just silly!!,positive
13170,I have never seen any other Tasks or To-Do List that has so many options/functions available. I am really impressed and appreciate this app.,positive
13171,This app really helps. It makes me organized in what i need to do especially when I am going out to go to the supermarket and buy stuffs.,positive
13172,"Seriously impressed with such a simple app. It's helped me go from writing list after lists in notebooks and losing them, to having it all on my phone whilst I'm out and about. Very convenient! I've already recommended to everyone I know who is like me with staying organized. Also being pregnant and having baby brain I find it hard to remember to take medication, so having a little reminder instead of an alarm is really handy. The snooze options are a wicked bonus. Thank you 🤩",positive
13173,"I don't usually rate apps , but I thought I must do for this one . I really like its simplicity and practicality , It has all the features that I needed , it's easy to use , ad free and all that is free of charge (I mean , it's so perfect 😀) . I really appreciate the hard work behind it . Thank you for this amazing app !",positive
13174,"Great app. I love this for my daily lists, shopping lists etc. I love it also has the sub lists with tasks. Would definately reccomend this app!",positive
13175,"Great Tasks and Reminder app. The dev has been responsive and implementa suggestions. Looking forward to further updates. Waiting for the web app and list sharing..EDIT: I believe this to be a 5star app, and will be once completed with the web app and list sharing. If it is 5 stars now, then there is no room for improvement. In Jan you stated in coming weeks, so it should be soon, we hope. Thank you for a great app. Looking forward to completion. I am a paid subscriber and always will be.",positive
13176,Works exactly as intended. Being able to separate tasks into categories and subtasks is especially useful.,positive
13177,So far this app has been terrific. With all its catagories that you can organize your tasks into it keeps it from getting cluttered and confusing. So far all the alarms have been working and functioning as they are supposed to and it has been easy to use with a quick tutorial when you first open it up.,positive
13178,"Love it. Exactly what I was looking for. Nice looking, very functional, and it can go on my homescreen with check boxes. 10/10",positive
13179,I love how I can write done everything and it helps me stay organized. It feels great to tick off completed tasks.,positive
13180,Great for organization. I love the color scheme and wide access. Works great with reminders and has a good set up👍🏻,positive
13181,"Amazing app. I use it to track everything from art projects, bills, grocery lists, even my food counter!",positive
13182,"Perfect, it is brilliant for everything I need. I have even thrown away my old to do list notepad!!!!!!",positive
13183,"Great, simple, and useful. I wanted a checklist that would function directly from the desktop background of my phone, and this works perfectly for that. Intuitive, easy, and reliable, and nothing more than what I want. Update:A year later & still no better task app for a Samsung. Updates only made this app better. Sublists are easy to organize. Setting controls very useful. I don't use it for reminders b/c it doesn't get my attention as well as my phone's alarm.",positive
13184,"Been using this app for a year now, and have created something like 20 lists that contain sublists, reminders, to-do's, groceries, pretty much anything and everything, and I've been so pleased with the whole experience. In my opinion, this is the best task app for Android, and the developer tries to sort out issues and responds quickly to feedback. I Highly recommend this app.",positive
13185,"This is a great app. It's peaceful to look at, easy to use. I really wanted a flylady app (housecleaning reminders), and was able to add those routines tonight. I will uncheck the daily chores every night, work away at the weekly zones, and get my house back in shape! Meanwhile, I keep track of grocery lists, who needs new shoes, big city reminders for our next trip. Thanks for making such a simple, versatile, customizable tool!",positive
13186,"Great app! Like that you can get a reminder for your task, either as a notification or alarm. One can also choose to write a task that doesn't have a reminder. Therefore you can also easily create lists, like a shopping list. It has the feature for quick add for that purpose.",positive
13187,"This app is AMAZING! I've tried so many to-do list apps, but this is by far the best! It allows you to do so many things! I would definitely recommend this to anyone!",positive
13188,Best app I have downloaded thus far. Keeps all my task organized with a easy to use app and no annoying ads. Highly recommend!,positive
13189,"I was looking for an app that let me make todo lists (for my lazy self) that met the following criteria: 1) Something that looked decent. 2) Something that let me set reminders in case I needed it. 3) Something that's quick, easy, and intuitive to use. This app is all of the above and more. I'm speechless from how amazingly simple and nice-looking the app is. I love being able to set custom colors. If only I could have it on my computer too! (Maybe widgets in the future?) Well done, Steve :)",positive
13190,I have never rated an app before. I rave about it to others. It's the perfect blend of simplicity and options to customize. I love having the widget on my phone. I expanded it so I can see many items on my list. I love the different options for reminders and snoozing. I have a hard time transitioning from task to task. Only thing I struggle with is the manual reorder of tasks (hold and drag). Works better for moving tasks down than up. Maybe my screen is not responsive enough or I'm clumsy.,positive
13191,"Okay decided to write the review because this app is just amazing. It's simple and functional. I love the fact how easily you can create tasks, set time etc. The only thing I'd like an option to set up default settings, like always have an alarm automatically on for the tasks I create. I can finally delete all other task/ reminded apps. Found my perfect solution. Love it",positive
13192,"Love that you can have multiple lists and also that you can reorganize the items on your list. When you complete an item, you can either check it off with an automatic date stamp or swipe it off completely 👍. This app has a very easy learning curve and I'm sure it probably has even more cool things that I have not discovered yet!",positive
13193,This is an excellent product allowing you make to make main lists with sub-lists where needed. I have hectic days and it helps me to remember what I have to do and keep a track of all the small things. Would love if lists could be shared with a someone and also an export to a chat (whatsapp) would make this a 5 star product. Thanks for the info Steve. Just rated you as 5 star. That does help me a lot and I'm sure many others as well who use WhatsApp.,positive
13194,Best one so fall... love it more than Keep Notes... I don't accidentaly loose menus etc and keeping track of sub-lists is easier.,positive
13195,"Excellent app. Well thought features. So far in my experience with a few task apps earlier, I can say this is ""The best"". Thanks and all the best to the team. Editing the review to add this:. I have upgraded to premium version. In the last few days of my trial, this app has substantially increased my productivity. Considering the benefits & satisfaction of completing tasks without missing them, the paid subscription is more than justified. Thank you!",positive
13196,"Really intuitive but also has loads of functionality. Looks great, very responsive (even on my low-spec phone), does much more than Google equivalent, worth moving to if you want your calendar to be separate from your to-do lists (I do). That said, I'm confident there would be some fairly easy way to do almost anything with this app. Never felt better about giving five stars to an app!",positive
13197,"A super-quick response from the dev sorted out my issue with the alarm sound, so now this little app is perfect for me. You can sort your tasks into lists; you can be reminded, by notification or alarm, any amount of time beforehand; you can set a priority for tasks... and probably more that I haven't discovered yet. Now I just need a busier life.",positive
13198,I love this app. It is an easy to use and appealing format. I like being able to move items around on my list of taks without having to re-type or cut and paste. I like the option to leave completed items on the list or have them automatically deleted. I would recommend this app to my friends looking for a good app to help with to-do lists.,positive
13199,Great app. Unfortunately the price for the cloud sync (the only premium feature I need) is rather high,positive
13200,"Love this app, I've been more productive since using it. Well designed, easy and convenient to use.",positive
13201,Love It eventhough we need to learn a little how to use this app. But when you get used to it you'll find it very easy,positive
13202,Just started using it.. I'm very organized & working from home during this pandemic is easier with the task to do list app :-),positive
13203,I have searched lots of app for goal planning. This one is best of them. Easy to use.,positive
13204,"I used to keep my to-do list in a simple text file with a bullet point denoting each task to be done. I decided that I needed a better way to organise my ‘to-dos’ and this app met my requirements perfectly. With this app you can arrange your to-dos in order of priority, set reminders, and so forth. The interface is well-designed and can be quickly mastered. The developer has written a very useful web-based help page that will enable you to get the most out of the app.",positive
13205,"Helps me be organised! It's great that it has no ads. Thanks, Stephen. I really like the icon on my home screen as well. A little thing, but it cheers me up to look at it. I originally gave the app 4 stars only because I don't like committing myself to 5. But on reflection I think you deserve full points. I haven't explored all the features yet so will get back to you when I do.",positive
13206,Just retired and struggled with getting a routine. I like to keep the same tasks on my morning routine and my evening routine. Check them off...then uncheck later for the next day. I made a to do task for things that are not the norm. I really like this...its a help and keeps me from chasing squirrels,positive
13207,"Very easy to use, helps me to not miss things that aging was making me forget!",positive
13208,Very versatile app. I used this primarily as a to-do list and grocery list.,positive
13209,"EDIT: Nope, changing it to 5 stars anyway, it's great right now and will be brilliant when the web integration is implemented. Thank you Stephen, incredible work! Absolutely love this app and found it far more suited to my needs than any of the bigger To Do apps. Looking forward to signing up for the paid version and giving 5 stars when the web integration is rolled out, then it will be absolutely perfect.",positive
13210,Works great! User friendly and comes with a variety of colors to choose from. The colors are nice and they are adjustable to your liking. Easy to organize and to navigate. It's simple and functional. I like how you can set the notification to make it stay on there forever until you swipe it to the side. That way I am still informed about something important while it's still visible on my screen in case I miss the reminder.,positive
13211,"I use this app every day for work mostly but also for personnal tasks or ideas. Easy to use, intuitive and convenient. I love the home screen widget where I can stick a list there for frequent view and quick access. Keep up the good work Dev(s). Great app! Very practical! Haven't seen any bugs yet after over a year of usage",positive
13212,"This app works really well. It let's me organize my tasks & reminds me when they're due, with the ability to give me the option of reminding me early, much like the calendar on my phone. I just like having this app as a backup reminder so I don't screw up & forget them (which I seem to be able to do occasionally anyway). Since I've yet to find any bugs, I highly recommend this app.",positive
13213,"The UI is incredibly intuitive, and there are so many ways to organize your tasks.",positive
13214,Its a great Tasks app. For me i really appreciate the ability to send a task to my calendar. Thank you,positive
13215,So convenient & easy to use!! A REAL game changer for me in managing my home business & home life simultaneously!!,positive
13216,This task app has been very helpful at organizing things that I do on a daily basis especially making list for shopping or getting gifts for friends. I've never personally used location tracking so that I can list out a specific location but I'm sure that it works perfectly fine as long as your GPS works as well. I would definitely recommend this to those that are looking for more organization to their day! 5/5 stars.,positive
13217,"Excellent tool to organize tasks in multiple lists. Thank you for developing it. A few more features would be helpful such as synching the scheduled tasks with Google or outlook calendar, moving set of tasks from one list to another, saving and restoring to an online account or preferably to an Excel sheet or a CSV, etc. It is working wonders for me in the current form, however would love to have these on the top. Good luck, and thanks again.",positive
13218,Outstanding app!! I really tried some and this is the only one that helps me. Thanks!!,positive
13219,Good for making yourself checklists. You can organize activity checklists. Like you can have a bigger checklists with sublists,positive
13220,A great recommended app. Finding it useful so far. Be great if available on computer too to sync. I had been using another good app for years but recently gotten taken over by big company and absorb resulting in event forced to use their alternative. Searched for replacement and discovered this app by accident and it is FANTASTIC! Easy to use and great features makes organising life a breeze. Very happy so far.,positive
13221,"Wunderlist app is now going away. So when I received their email notification, I started to look for an app that is equal or better with what I currently use. Fortunately, there is this Tasks that is a great app. Easy to use, so helpful with the Sublist, has different colors for management, and the Reminder List can be set to your own time preference. Thank you Mr. Stephen Nottage!",positive
13222,"Love that you can have several lists, and sub lists, and set reminders/deadlines.",positive
13223,"I hardly ever leave reviews but had to make an exception here... App is colourful, looks great and easy to use! Love the ability to add sub-tasks and set reminders. Nearly all features are free to use with no ads. Massive props goes out to the dev! Also never seem a dev so active in the reviews section helping users and taking suggestions on board. Very well done!",positive
13224,"The best widget! You can swap lists without ever leaving your home screen. And they're all color coded, yay! I like that you can use it simple way or a complicated way, depending on what you need, but the complexity never gets in the way of the simple use. Thank you for this app.",positive
13225,"Brilliant app, simple to use and does everything I need from a to do list",positive
13226,"Its perfect,I really recommend downloading it,it has the priority of your works,calendar,etc...thank you so much!it is so useful",positive
13227,It's one of the well thought App which has been developed. I think it has user friendly and very nice features to manage our work. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who what's to manage their work! Best thing is no advertisement or any other annoying thing to distract.,positive
13228,"I love this app! Simple, easy to use. Easy to organize or reorginaze and shuffle my tasks around as needed. This is the best task app that I've ever tried and I've tried quite a few. High five to the developer. Now I want it for desktop and across all of my devices. I hope that option is coming soon!",positive
13229,"Yeah, it is really good. Also i don't know how to make a daily reminder. Plus, the tasks in my widget disappears and i don't know how to put it back.",positive
13230,Still the best by far and even better with online sync & backup. This is the first todo list I've ever paid for and been happy to do it. I love the granular approach to organisation so you can get as complex as you like. I use it every day for just about everything.,positive
13231,"This app has changed my life, I'd give it 10 stars if I could. It helps me manage my day to day tasks by making a list for every day of the week and switching between lists. I like that there is a widget available on my pixel phone so that I can see my checklists on my home screen.",positive
13232,"What a great app! I love that I can create sub tasks. I also love that I can move the finished tasks to specific tabs. It makes it easy for me to tell which of my orders have been paid, which have been completed and which have been sent.",positive
13233,I love this app!!! FYI although it is a free to use app I dont remember seeing a single ad!!!! Definietely reccomend,positive
13234,"I love this app! It helps me to stay organized. It's very convenient. I used to write my to do list on paper, but it's so much easy to have this app right at my finger tips. Its allows me to break my list down into categories, and use different colors to differentiate each category.",positive
13235,I love the interface and the colors. It's very smooth and fun to look at,positive
13236,Great features! Easy to use and modify list details.,positive
13237,"CONVENIENT! COLORFUL! FEATURES AND SETTINGS CATER TO LIST-LOVERS! I've always enjoyed hand writing lists for everything & had zero interest in switching or including tech for list making. I HAD to install 'Tasks' to make a list during an apartment move-in evaluation. To my PAPERLESS surprise, there were more issues than I thought I could recall from memory. Ended up making FOUR lists w/ this app on the 1st day. Now I'm listbidextrous! Got twice as many w/ both written & app made lists!",positive
13238,Especially like that there is a widget option where you can put your tasks on your home screen and be reminded of the tasks you set. Very dynamic app yet simple is appearance and interface. Helpful and not over the top!,positive
13239,"Really impressed with the functionality, by far the best to do app out there. Functionality is great and the UI is even better - clean, intuitive and perfect to utilize. 10/10 for the lists, sublists and subtasks, even the editable homescreen widget is quality. Looking forward to the paired web app.",positive
13240,It is really good and dies not have any ads also is really good for when tidying up,positive
13241,"Works great! No ads, no unnecessary complexity",positive
13242,Sweet App! Super clean interface. Simple and straightforward. Me likey,positive
13243,Great app! Love how you can easily attach it to your homescreen and interact with everything though the widget. Its completely changed how I've kept myself organized. Definitely the best one out there!,positive
13244,"This app is the best thing ever First i had the task list from 2010 and i was organising my life and my work,and i thought it was the best,until the new updates and i could not use it anymore and i was so sad But now i found Tasks, which is 10 time better,and i am only 4 hous on it. Thanks again for the creator and the team Great work",positive
13245,"For someone who does this on the side, the developer is the most responsive I've ever seen! I've tried at least 6 other popular list apps, and this one is my favorite. It does the best job of laying out lists and sublists that I could find.",positive
13246,Helps me a lot! Thank you!,positive
13247,"A great, no charge organizer.",positive
13248,I got it for the widget. Man it keeps me on task!,positive
13249,Very good app,positive

13261,So far I have used this app to check off things I hope to get done each day. Now I am making a list of short term goals to check off. This will help me get them done soon and feel like I have accomplished something. It will keep reminding me to get them done.,positive
13262,Love it,positive
13263,"This app is very easy to use. It's simple but effective. I have a to do list function on my phone won't say what kind of phone, but it's very hard to understand, so I write everything down on paper, and then lose it.",positive
13264,Once worked out how to use have found it very useful for listing daily items to do.,positive

13294,By far the best task management app!,positive
13295,"This is the closest app I've found since my last upgrade & lost a similar app. Best thing about it, it's VERY user friendly & everythings right at my fingertips. I'm still getting used to it, but loving it so far! I have only one change I'd like to see. I love how I can change the arrangement in my lists, could you make it so I can change the arrangement of my catagories as well. Thank you & I hope I don't loose this one when it comes time to upgrade!",positive
13296,"Easy to install very similar to wunderlist but much easier. Was a wunderlist user for over 5 years loved the app kept my finances on straight and narrow thank you for do this amazing list. Did not like the new microsoft office task list far to difficult to get let alone use. I don't have time to fiddle around on phone and this takes me straight to my lists.

13305,Love this app!!!,positive
13306,"This app is great! BUT I am having one issue that is dragging me away to other apps I like less overall. My work lunch hour switches every week between 11:00am and 12:00pm. I wish there was a way I could have a task repeat ""every two weeks on weekdays"" so that I could have these 2 tasks auto rotate weeks. Is this possible in this app?",positive

13326,Very easy to use and very useful - thanks.,positive
13327,Handy app for reminding me what to get at the shop's and recording my hours as I'm a temporary placement employee,positive
13328,Especially like that there is a widget option where you can put your tasks on your home screen and be reminded of the tasks you set. Very dynamic app yet simple is appearance and interface. Helpful and not over the top!,positive

13330,I love this app!!! FYI although it is a free to use app I dont remember seeing a single ad!!!! Definietely reccomend,positive

13345,I love it! Helps me stay organised.,positive
13346,"I recently switched over from the original business calendar app which I have been using for many years. This version has a fancier UI but functionally seems much the same as far as the calendar goes which is fine, if it ain't broke don't fix it! I think other features have been added but I don't really use them. Update: full screen ads suck. They appear and cannot be closed for a long time. Show me an ad if you must but let me close it, the free version is unusable this.",negative
13347,"I am going to drop this app after years of use because of recent full page video ads which are out of control. Edited to add: of course the free version has ads. Always has, and I don't mind, because *something* has to pay for app development. But these new full page, video that can't be shut down, in your face for many seconds ads are new and intolerable. That was a bad business mistake you can correct. I hope you correct it soon. I'll be checking back to see.",negative
13348,Resonse (2/13/20): I know that the free version is not ad-free.  The issue that what you have done recently is to force people to watch ads instead of just clicking them away. And this happens while I'm trying to add or edit something on the calendar. Had to change from 5 to 1 star because of these pop up ads. Will be looking for a new app soon.,negative
13349,"Ads with free apps are acceptable, but fullscreen & non-skippable ads blocking the entire screen for 20 seconds are NOT. Awful user experience. Google has recently removed 600 Android apps from Play Store because of disruptive fullscreen ads, this app may be the next one to be removed. Not recommended.",negative
13350,"Its a great app I used for years. I was ok with ads, but the full screen can't be immediately banished ads make it unusable. When I need Calendar info, I need it RIGHT NOW. I'll give it a couple of weeks but if it doesn't go back to discrete corner ads I'm out. Edit post response: I'd have paid a couple of bucks for ad free version, because it is better than stock Calendar. But its not 7 bucks better. So if you're not going to remove full screen ads, after years of using, gotta say buh bye...",negative

I don't mind a full page ad that I can back out of or scrolling ads at the bottom, but to force me to watch a 5 second ad is not reasonable. Seems like they're forcing you to pay up or move on to another app. If this continues I'll find another app.",negative
13352,"Love this calendar up until a few days ago. The ads used to be fairly non-intrusive, which I get and could totally live with. Now they have a full screen animation that you have to wait on to use the calendar. Totally unacceptable when I'm with a customer. Absolutely do NOT recommended this calendar as currently configured.",negative
13353,"I've had this app for years, even upgraded it to the premium version. Loved it.. then as the developers started updating, I started having many issues. Each time i used the app it would show in the premium or free version; it was inconsistent. I wrote the customer service for assistance and I didn't get any help. So i lived with it. Most recently, I started receiving ads after every entry; Not okay!! I sent another email 2 wks ago which they have not responded to; which is why I'm here. Help!",negative
13354,"Used this app for years, but I can not tolerate the recent full page video ads that pop up after every calendar entry. I use the free version which I know is sponsored by Ad, the recent updates allow intrusive , excess ads that you can even skip and I can't renter the app to verify my calendar entry was added/modified corrected. The developer or owner has really overstepped with the recent updates and ads. I'm going back to the free Google app instead. I hope you push out a new update before y",negative
13355,This used to be a very good calendar app with plenty of good features in the free version already. Unfortunately they introduced intrusive full-screen ads recently to force you into buying the premium version. I'll rather switch to another calendar app than be blackmailed like that.,negative
13356,Used this calendar for years without any issue. Now ads will take over the entire screen after entering an appointment in the calendar and there is a delay before you can cancel them out. Terrible and disappointing choice on the part of the developers. They've lost me as a user as I refuse to pay for a pro version for a simple calendar app. Do yourself a favor and stay away. The ads suck and are annoying.,negative
13357,"Excellent UI. Easy to use and sync to gmail. Events and tasks all at once. Since the last update on Feb 13, 2020, this app shows video ad. after modify calendar which you cannot close until the ad is finished. You have to be careful if you are in quiet environment ie meetings.",negative
13358,"Used the free version for years, no issues, didn't need the pro features. Then they started putting in ads - not the kind that pop up along the bottom but ones that completely hijack the screen while you're trying to work. Worst bait-and-switch I've ever seen.",negative
13359,"I have used this app for a couple of years now and it was great. It had small banner ads before, however recently they have incorporated video ads which play every time you input a new plan. This is incredibly tedious and a massive waste of time. DO NOT DOWNLOAD.",negative
13360,"Great app but why do you need 13 Ad trackers in this paid for pro app? Exodus privacy list 13 trackers against your app which is rediculous. Using this every day, but now concerned my every move is being tracked 13 times. Edit: You inform, so that makes it okay then, for you. Perhaps other more privacy focussed users should look elsewhere. How do I confirm the trackers are not used? Trust you, I bet.... 13 are for revenue, 1 will suffice for personalising.",negative
13361,"Recent addition of VERY intrusive full-screen video ads has crossed a line. At first I thought my phone had been hacked! I totally understand need for revenue for a great free app, but this is too much. I'm going elsewhere very soon without a change!",negative
13362,"UNSKIPPABLE video ads pop up when you are adding or editing an event. I mean video ads popping up in a *calendar* app is bush league already, but unskippable? May as well have a boxing glove on a spring pop out of my phone and smash my groin - that's probably preferable.",negative
13363,"Ads started appearing whenever I'd modify something. Not cool. Edit: I have no problems with banner ads, but ads that completely disable functionality for a period of time completely defeats the purpose of using this app for better functionality.",negative
13364,"Using the app since years, now whenever open the app, trying to save an entry, full page advertisement opens for atleast 30 seconds causes missing what more to enter on different dates, this app is at its worst",negative
13365,"Developer started to add invasive ads, and worst of all, the functionality that was working before, is not working anymore. Probably the app is busy with the invasive ad and forgot about the job at hand :) And yes, I know about the payed version",negative
13366,"Used to be good. Now massive full screen adds with sound. First time they ran without warning, very embarrassing. Will give it a week to revise, then will uninstall. Adds are ok, but the full screen nature with sound isn't.",negative

13368,My go to for years. Until the last update. Ads used to be unintrusive. Now you have to wait 10 seconds after every calendar update for the ad to run. Uninstalling now.,negative
13369,I am also looking to change after years of usage. The app stooping to advertising unless a NEW upgrade is paid is dishonest. I paid for my old version and was satisfied with its functionality. Not interested in your new version,negative
13370,The ads are a joke. Completely destroyed the experience. Maybe they haven't tried searching for calendar on the play store and noticed the hundred other options? Look elsewhere for calendar needs!,negative
13371,The link provided is the same robot answer I received by email. I still cannot download the the pro version I bought as it was removed from the market. If you remove it from the market then obvisouly no one can download it. And if it is not removed. Provide the download link. Else do not tell your customers that it is a perpetual license. Did you ever hear about short links??,negative
13372,"I've used this calendar for years. It has always been the best. But now they've added ads. Unless those go away, I'll be finding a new calendar.",negative
13373,Used to be 5 stars. I've used this app for years.... The sudden addition of full page unskipable adds ruined it. It looks like I'm not alone in my disappointment.,negative
13374,"Awful! At one point, I bought the Business Calendar 2 app, and I the update has ads. I'm supposed to purchase the newest version? Yeah, no thanks.",negative
13375,"It used to be the BEST calendar for many years, TILL NOW, when annoying advertisements are popping up all the time. So sad, but it's totally intolerable, need to Uninstall and find another app",negative
13376,I understand the need to play ads in a free version. But your ads are going for 30 seconds before you can get rid of them which makes this app unusable.,negative
13377,Terrible when you get a new phone! Only about half my data transferred when I updated my phone!! Months of scheduled events don't show up now!! Not happy at all with this app!!!,negative
13378,Loved it until they added cartoon ads. You'll be with a client and a video game comes up as you're scheduling their appointment. Makes us look very unprofessional.,negative
13379,"5 up to 15 seconds are too much for staring at an add in an app that is listed under ""productivity"". Already expecting the lame excuse given to all the comments. Please rethink if you want to go the ""standard"" way you mention, or if a developer should try to give its best and attract users. I'm in favour of ads in free app versions, but this is too much!",negative
13380,"Does not sync automatically. Very frustrating. Have to go in and ""Sync Now"" even though setting is set to sync every hour. Done with this app",negative
13381,"DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP. I used to love it, but in the most recent update the advertisements have made it absolutely unusable. I am switching to google calendar and never looking back",negative
13382,Unskippable pop up video adds with sounds. Awful and completely inappropriate for 'business' as the name suggests. I shall look forward to deleting this app and avoiding this developer from now on.,negative
13383,The new full-screen video advertisements make the basic version of this app unusable. I'm looking looking for a replacement.,negative
13384,Never responded to my original review in 2019 and the response to my latest review still doesn't answer the fact that any tasks that are recurring DO NOT show in calendar even though you sync this information.,negative
13385,Used to be good but started showing full screen ads even when the app is not open. Currently unusable.,negative
13386,The pop-up advertisements make the free version impossible to use. I will be forced to change to a different app after years of use,negative
13387,"I don't mind ads, but not those which run in full screen mode and cannot be closed by me.",negative
13388,Full screen ads you can't skip every time you add or edit an event !!!,negative

13390,Full screen video ads! I can live with banner ads but not this.,negative
13391,"Used this app for months with no issues but after most recent update it plays an ad every time I add a new event to my calender, awful",negative
13392,App starts ads after 1 month and opens wanting paid every time after the first month.,negative
13393,updated and the only thing new is ADS. deleting after years of use over multiple phones.,negative
13394,Deleting. Was great. Now horrible. Bad move with the ads guys.,negative

13400,Too many long ads,negative
13401,Paid for the upgrade but the weather functionality doesn't work and moving between months inside the calendar is not intuitive. I'd like a refund please.,negative

13407,Paid for Pro version. Money taken. App is EXACTLY THE SAME as before payment. Scammed.,negative
13408,"Full screen ads ruin it all I've been using this since it was just ""business calendar"". It was still $7 back then so I wouldn't buy it but would click the ads every now and then. Now with the full screen ads it's practically unusable. Also, before the dev comes in with the stock ""the free version has ads"" response: no duh it has ads. We didn't pay for the app because its upfront cost is too high so we liked the corner ads. Now you force them to take over our screens. Uninstalled and 1-Star.",negative
13409,Functionality for which I paid has been removed in Android 10. I AM SICK TIRED OF THIS STUFF GOING ON.,negative
13410,"I uninstalled it within 20 minutes of paying for it. Its features don't work as hoped, especially font and color customization: the unpaid version advertised *presets*, aka themes. But they didn't exist in the Pro. This is on an Android 10, Oxygen 10.3.1 TMUS 1+6T. Developer, your 2020.3.3 reply makes no sense: it still doesn't take into account this *particular* phone or my specific terms. Here's to those themes in future releases, along with a dynamic icon, and the developer's professionalism.",negative
13411,I have been a subscriber of the pro version for years when this new version came out I tried it and there were problems. I tried it again and it seems to work well. I tried running with one alarm and now it dosen't stop when I acknowledge it I'm going back to the old version. I have removed pro 2 if the problem pesiststs I will have to find a new calendar. Very frustrated.,negative
13412,Don't bother installing this app. The free version is garbage. Recently the developer made the decision for inclusion of ads. The ads pop up every time you add an event to the Calendar. The developer has chosen to sacrifice usability of the app and consumer comfort in the rush to monetise the app. I have uninstalled it and will not be returning to the app again.,negative
13413,"I used to love this calendar, but now it has full screen ads/videos that take over your phone. Can't do anything else while the pop-up ad is running. First one of these I saw - UNINSTALLED!! ... Response: The ads definitely come up more than twice per day and the calendar is definitely NOT functional while the ads are running - you must wait for the commercial to end before you can open the calendar again. I can understand bar ads at the top or bottom of a free app, but full length commercials?!",negative
13414,"I used to like, even love this app. It was great. Now though, every time I add an event on my calendar an ad comes up and stays there until it is finished. It's awful! So far the ads have not been inappropriate, just annoying. I don't think that going to the pro version would fix this. I don't even know how to find the pro version to purchase as it doesn't show up in the play store. Super frustrating. I don't want to find another app. I just want this one to work without the silly ads.",negative
13415,"I paid for this app, and it was a wonderful app, easy platform, customisable. BUT, there has been a recent addition of ads. All the time! For an app I have paid for I think this is disgusting. I response to you, no these aren't spam events linked to my phone. I uninstalled this app and used my original paid version of the called app and there are no ads. I was prompted to update to this version a while ago. I thought it was just an ad on from the paid version of business calendar I had.",negative

13419,"Best free calendar is now unacceptable with full audio, full screen video ads. The price to avoid the ad mugging is ridiculously too much. Uninstalled and looking for another.",negative
13420,"The app per se is good. Sadly the customer service when you have an issue is no where to be found. For about a month i have sent emails since the app after an update went back to basic, even after paying the pro version about 3 years ago. No help has been provided after all this time. In my view, you can make it or break it when you take care of your paying customer or ignore him. It seems like they dont see it that way. Perhaps now they will pay attention.",negative
13421,"Wow. Had a 30 second ad that gave me the uninstall this app command. I used to like the 1st but eventually moved to the 2nd but after that atrocious ad, I uninstalled and used google calendar which the widget is not as nice but works great.",negative

13423,"Been using this app for years, This app called itself business calendar but now includes popups which blasts the speaker at full volume. How am I supposed to use this app during BUSINESS MEETINGS??

13424,Ads interrupt you while adding items to your calendar. This app used to have a banner for ads at the bottom which was fine. Now the ads are annoying and timed. Reply to developer: No thanks. I rather uninstall your app completely. 👌,negative

13428,Reminder works but I scroll down from top I see the correct items !bc not Google! . If I open I see some old reminders... Sometimes they update. Mostly NOT....

13429,"Whenever creating a new event, it doesn't use the calendar's default reminders, which Google Calendar does, so I have to use Google Calendar to add new events.

13430,"I used to love this... now on my phone it's oddly presenting and tasks are worthless, no syncing, and just too much work. Seems to have been since last update. Support I was given was also unhelpful. Went into actual google calendar and realized it hadn't been syncing for 3 plus weeks Uninstalled. Reinstalled. Half way working but now its showing I dont have premium (wrong) and wont let me access. 6 hours now... big ""pro' stamped across app. We shall see how long until my next contact.",negative

13433,Why do you say that you can disable permissions at any time but then the app DOESN'T WORK AT ALL if you do? Why have an app on your phone that you will never use? I have disabled the Google app on my phone for a reason. It's gone completely psycho generating up to three completely nonsensical events and associated 6 reminders every week. The only way to stop it was to completely disable it. Why do you think I was looking for a calendar app to begin with? Why do you need another calendar app in,negative
13434,Since you have put advertisements in app i say goodbye.. On top of that an update came up and isn't possible to view description of booked day unless you click on it. Disappointed.,negative
13435,NOTE TO SELF::: I did find an app that does not need my personal details in order to function. EDIT::: It is clear that the developers of this app have absolutely no idea what they're doing because their app DID request a password from me; a password I was not willing to give. I don't care that they are calling me a liar. I am not asking anybody anything - I am merely telling prospective clients what I experienced with this app and to be careful. There are more secure apps available out there.,negative

13437,"So, 2 (almost 3) years ago I purchased the pro version of this app. At the time, that unlocked access to all present and future ""pro"" aspects. Now, however, after a long list of changes, the fact that I have already paid for this app and been using it for years doesn't seem to matter. I'm now constantly being asked to repurchase a product I already own. To add insult to injury, features that used to be standard (drag & drop) are now a pro feature, that I should already own, cost $6.99 and up.",negative
13438,"Compared to version 1 - poor. Allows for editing one entry of (for example) a weekly appointment, but rather than edit the one instance (as you think you are doing) it creates a new one, so you have a double entry, the original which you can't delete, even after synching. If you've set weekly appointments and one is cancelled, you should be able to edit that one instance without creating a duplicate. I've had this installed for some time now, thinking that the developers would resolve these problems, but although the app has regular 'updates', nothing has changed. Drag and drop defaults to copy, imo should be 'move' by default. If you change an appointment it changes, not duplicates. Also the interface and look (big text and colours) looks like a children's calender, while the original version actually looked quite professional.",negative
13439,"The features and functionality are pretty good, with support for Google Tasks. BUT the homescreen widget doesn't load at all on Android 9 after restarting the device.

It's not ideal but understandable to have the export calendar function as a pro feature. But then, my phone malfunctioned and I was unable to access this apps. There is no online syncing or a web version so that I can refer back to. edit: I have try the syncing method in FAQ. Most of my calendars are local calendars which I fail to sync or switch them to Google calendar.",negative

Show me an ad if you must but let me close it, the free version is unusable this.",negative
13517,Resonse (2/13/20): I know that the free version is not ad-free.  The issue that what you have done recently is to force people to watch ads instead of just clicking them away.

The app forced there to be a day of the week listed in the repeat schedule, so that it would say something like ""repeat weekly on Thursday on completion date."" --- Now, having a day of the week and also ""from completion date"" makes no sense, so I was curious what the app would do. I set my Tuesday task to repeat every Thursday from completion date and checked it off on a Sunday. The app should have rescheduled the task for the following Sunday, but it didn't.

It gets much worse if I don't use the app for a few days! Then I have to mark all recurring tasks as done for every and each previous day!!!!  - The app forces me to record false information! A task that was not done on a specific day, should stay there as NOT done, and the recurring task should be generated for the following day.  - You have only 3 options for a recurring task: 1) to mark it as done in order for it to appear on the following day. 2) not to mark it as done, and it will never ""recur""! 3) to delete, and it disappears, and naturally, it will never ""recur""!

First off the editing features such as bolding, underlining, line numbering, etc don't appear anywhere unless like in my case you accidently discover them by doing a couple of steps of bizarre gymnastics. Once found I loved the features. However the first thing that is annoying is that if you have a long list of things that go past one screen you have to keep scrolling down to access those features. Would be nice if there was a button or tab that would open a stationary bar at the top or a floating window that moves with the screen.

First off the editing features such as bolding, underlining, line numbering, etc don't appear anywhere unless like in my case you accidently discover them by doing a couple of steps of bizarre gymnastics. Once found I loved the features. However the first thing that is annoying is that if you have a long list of things that go past one screen you have to keep scrolling down to access those features. Would be nice if there was a button or tab that would open a stationary bar at the top or a floating window that moves with the screen. Second issue is definitely a software bug having to do with the line numbering. Once a line numbering list has been established and you want to go back to add a new line or change the priority by moving things up and down the system does odd things.",neutral

I especially love the integration of the to do /task list within the app. I use the Agenda view on the widget and couldn't be more pleased. As the title says, I love it! Several years later and still living it. Wouldn't think of changing it for anything. Rating dropped from 5 to 3 stars. Too many features removed with recent updates.",neutral
14111,"the widget keeps distorting itself. resize fixes it, but not for long. edit: monthly widget, nova launcher. Nova launcher has worled great for me trough several Android versions.

14112,"I love BC1 and BTasks, but am disappointed that BC2 will not bring my tasks from BT and the new integrated BT syncs only to Google tasks but no longer my Toodle-Do account. Deal breaker for me!  Why would you break the functionality with your own BTasks app???",neutral

14114,"I have been using this app for years, but I am thinking of trying a different app. The issue that I have, is that doing seemingly simple tasks is overly complicated. For example I just want to make a personal and a work task list that is local to my phone. Doing so has proven very complex and often I will create a task only to realize it has defaulted to my gmail account rather than the local list I intended. As a user it's frustrating, the reason I use this app is to streamline organization.",neutral
14115,"It WAS really great until I bought my Samsung S9 (was using an S6 prior), and when I transferred the Business Calendar program to the S9 the calendar's Search Function no longer worked. I ask you, how useful is a ""business cakendar"" without a ""Search Function?""",neutral
14116,"Great app, easy to use and convenient. I love the vertical scrolling in the month view.

Sorry for the comment that I have left even when I was not sure.. I thought that way because a lot of popups have ben shown when I was using this app..

14144,Really like this calendar app and would recommend to other users. Though it really does need SMS support for sending automatic reminders to event attendees. By that I mean I would like to be able to create an event and add an attendee. When the event reminder comes round I would want the invited attendee to be sent a SMS text message reminding them in advance of the event.

I keep that for personal use and this one for business, obviously. But now they both sync and show the same things, whichever calendar I select, so I cannot use them differently. I hope there is a way around this, otherwise I will have to download a replacement.",positive
14149,"Have been using the old Pro version on all my previous devices for years and liked it very much. Just started to use this new one not long ago. It has a more contemporary design, simplified and streamlined options, but the change in drag n drop in weekly view costs it a star.",positive

Not sure if that's a Google thing or a thing for this app. Otherwise I like it a lot.",positive
14151,"I have been using the PRO version for several years now. It has many nice features and sophisticated calendar widget with many customization options. Sadly, lately there have been problems with task synchronization. As I mostly use tasks/todos for organizing and use multiple devices, this is a big issue for me.

14155,its a good calendar! . Definitely bettwr then most and if they keep up Ill continue to use it.

14157,A capable calendar. My main grumble is that it notifies me of calendar events after they have passed. Sometimes a day or so later. Even more annoying is Google notifying me of events when I don't use its calendar. The calendar would be better if the developers included a facility to stop Google reading my calendar entries.,positive
14158,"Have been using this now for over a year, after trying a few. It is absolutely the best. All depends what you need it to do but it has great options and flexibility. Works just fine, I do have a slow to load glitch on the widget on the phone. Other than that it's great",positive
14159,"Their widgets had gotten better since my last review. I really appreciate the calendar with the tasks on the side! If there was a morning ""your day today"" or ""plan your day today"" alert in the morning, that would make it even better! I went to Any.do for that, but their calendar and sync to my waze app was off so I came back lol",positive
14160,Go overall application. I wish it was easier to make changes in already established recurring appointments and it would be nice to have a refresh button. Everything else works really well.,positive
14161,Very good... Just one point. When listing coming up tasks it would be good to have bands of background semi transparent color to highlight today's events and next 3 days events for example to be distinguished from far future events. All in one list with no distinction tends to be overlooked,positive
14162,"Is working as described. Could offer deleatable holiday date/names, with drag/drop rescheduleling... a query window where user could use a ""window of time"" (such as ""3:30pm to 8:30pm"" , 6 days a week (S-MTWTF), with ""30 minute travle time"") and locate new appointment opening automatically. It has been a useful app so far.",positive
14163,If you can get it on a good deal or already own the CB1 Pro (although one needs to install both app in order to get the pro fearures) than it's a no brainer. Well almost as it still can't sync google reminders into it's own task section which is a shame.,positive

14169,Great app but for some time I am not able to create an event from the widget. I have even paid for the app hoping it will resolve itself but this feature still isn't working properly.,positive

14171,My primary app for all my calendar needs. It works well. The pro version makes my life easier. Ild however give it a 5 star if i could put photos up directly into the calendar instead of loading it up as a link,positive
14172,"If only the authors would fix the issue with the wrong person displayed after clicking on the birthday box, I would consider paying for the premium version",positive

14179,"I needed a calendar that would extend my schedule to infinity and with multiple rotation scenarios for a variety of store visits. It does that great. Is it possible to simplify moving events (which actually are my store visits) to other days within the same week or month? It wud be great if you could just drag the store you missed to another day and it would only change that single event, not the rest in the rotation. Thanks.",positive
14180,"Amazing app, helps me organise different tasks and events with colour codes. Wish there was a notes page and a timetable so I could keep everything in one place!",positive

14182,I really love how i can see my task list and calendar side by side. The only reason why im not giving it a 5 is because i would really love a desktop version to use when im on my laptop.,positive
14183,"Very easy to use. However syncing with Google Calendar is slow for edits and deletes, and this is the reason for not placing a 5 star rating.",positive
14184,Very reliable but not great at retaining future appointments over one year. They seem to disappear!,positive
14185,This product does everything that I need for it to do and all that it says that it will do. It is easy and friendly to use and I enjoy it greatly and truly do rely on it daily,positive

14187,"Very good, been using for a few years now. The synch function is temperamental lately, perhaps an update changed something.",positive
14188,"Good tool to manage one or more calendars in one view. Connects to gmail, contacts, phone, google drive and more",positive
14189,It just works. Nice tight layout. Combines Google & Exchange/Activesync well. Wish I could jump ahead faster than 1 mo at a time.,positive
14190,I use free version and its useful for everyday tasks. 4 stars because there are too many ads.,positive
14191,Do you have any plan to make desktop view? I am using pro and pretty happy except that part. Getting more info for schedules and it would be amazing if it provides desktop view. A bit inconvenient as a one who is relying on this app a lot.,positive
14192,I used to really love this app. Too many ads for 5 stars now - but I upstill like the way it works.,positive
14193,Overall good and works well. Syncs with google calendar and is a little easier to work with.,positive

14195,Yes this is a great app. I like all the different variations and things I can tailor to my own needs.,positive
14196,I wish there was a task manager. Only reason for 1 star drop. Otherwise this app is working great for me.,positive

14222,"Great app, the best time setting interface of anything. Only feature I don't like is if you change the start time of an event it proportionally changes the end time so you have to change the end back to where it was and if you change it enough to span the midnight hour now you have to change the days too.",positive
14223,Great app but voice quality sometimes poor,positive
14224,I find it's useful and easy to check.,positive
14225,I like this apps. But I would like it better if it can show event description.,positive

With the holidays over, I need to resolve this and get back to work, and find that I can download other competing apps that work great. Please fix.",positive

14231,I have no problems with the app so it must be working.,positive
14232,Love this app! The only thing that is missing for me is the ability to long click on a day in any view and be able to give it a bespoke colour so I know that there is something important I need to be aware of on that date. If that was there it would be 5 stars,positive
14233,"Offers much more flexibility and I'm enjoying the new updates. The one thing I would like (for 5 star rating) is the ability to strike-through appointments that are cancelled, which was possible in the Palm Pilot and similar to the ""completed"" tasks that once you have ticked them off it will strike-through the item.",positive

Not sure if that's a Google thing or a thing for this app. Otherwise I like it a lot.",positive
14279,I used to really love this app. Too many ads for 5 stars now - but I upstill like the way it works.,positive
14280,The app is good. I am using the pro version since years. It works well with Google calendar. Now I want to use my Outlook calendar as well. But I can not find the possibility to add an Outlook calendar there. Do you have any suggestions for it?,positive
14281,I like the usability and design a lot. Unfortunately it has to be synced with your normal calender which is a deal breaker for me. I wanted to seperate work from my private life to keep a work life balance. It's sadly not possible with this app.,positive
14282,I have tied a few calenders. This one is good for multiple accounts. Easy to turn them off and on. Its quite clear on a phone screen,positive
14283,Nice format views and options. My only suggestion is to improve the options that can be assigned when creating a new event.,positive
14284,"Good but, too many ads..",positive
14285,Still enjoying this app after all these years,positive
14286,Do you have any plan to make desktop view? I am using pro and pretty happy except that part. Getting more info for schedules and it would be amazing if it provides desktop view. A bit inconvenient as a one who is relying on this app a lot.,positive
14287,"Their widgets had gotten better since my last review. I really appreciate the calendar with the tasks on the side! If there was a morning ""your day today"" or ""plan your day today"" alert in the morning, that would make it even better! I went to Any.do for that, but their calendar and sync to my waze app was off so I came back lol",positive
14288,"It works, me like. Bought the Pro ver.",positive
14289,Great calendar - bought the pro version for the previous version - just annoying to have to purchase again - otherwise would definitely buy the pro version!,positive
14290,its a good calendar! . Definitely bettwr then most and if they keep up Ill continue to use it. They also are constantly improving the app I'm having difficulties getting it to open on the correct day I'm sure it's just a setting I can't figure out the app keeps opening on a day for days from the current day,positive
14291,"Works well, nice interface",positive
14292,Great app but voice quality sometimes poor,positive
14293,I use free version and its useful for everyday tasks. 4 stars because there are too many ads.,positive
14294,Not the best but better than others,positive
14295,How do i add my agenda on the widget,positive
14296,Very good calendar.,positive
14297,Very good... Just one point. When listing coming up tasks it would be good to have bands of background semi transparent color to highlight today's events and next 3 days events for example to be distinguished from far future events. All in one list with no distinction tends to be overlooked,positive
14298,Very useful and functional.,positive
14299,Very good. Productivity booster,positive
14300,Very useful calendar for people in business and even for busy individuals.,positive
14301,Very nice application!,positive
14302,I like it so far,positive
14303,No issues so far...integrates nicely with all the software I use.,positive
14304,I luv it. Only downside is the adverts. But the app is awesome.,positive
14305,All good,positive
14306,"Love it, some pay features are annoying",positive
14307,"Nice clean app, good functionality.",positive
14308,So useful,positive
14309,"Just don't give 5 stars when not using most function, but those functions I use- totally satisfy my needs.",positive
14310,"It's great, the only issue I'm having is when I snooze something and it then occurs at the same time as another event they appear to get grouped together and I have to snooze or dismiss them both.",positive
14311,"Love it overall, but I had the worst time trying to get it to sync initially. I ended up installing the Google calendar app in order to get my Chromebook to sync on schedule, and then BC2 worked just fine (must have been the Chromebook?)",positive
14312,"Have been using this now for over a year, after trying a few. It is absolutely the best. All depends what you need it to do but it has great options and flexibility. Works just fine, I do have a slow to load glitch on the widget on the phone. Other than that it's great",positive
14313,"Needs more vibrant colors, perfect everywhere else.",positive
14314,Great calendar,positive
14315,"It's user-friendly and can be personalised very efficiently, but I am currently having issues with it overlapping with the built-in Google calendar. It didn't use to. I keep that for personal use and this one for business, obviously. But now they both sync and show the same things, whichever calendar I select, so I cannot use them differently. I hope there is a way around this, otherwise I will have to download a replacement.",positive
14316,Great app but for some time I am not able to create an event from the widget. I have even paid for the app hoping it will resolve itself but this feature still isn't working properly.,positive
14317,I find it's useful and easy to check.,positive
14318,love it,positive
14319,"App is really great! Too frequent updates, in last week 3 updates..",positive
14320,Supervb & smart,positive
14321,"Tons of features, and the features I need and want. However it often doesn't show my information, each line just says ""loading..."". It seems that most of the time they will eventually load. All the permissions are good....",positive
14322,Love this app. It makes viewing all my Google calendars in one apot easy! My only issue is entering locations because I live in a rural area and it recommends places in large cities all the time.,positive
14323,"Why can I see (and create) task lists from only one account? I have 3 google accounts on my phone, only one of them are in the tasks list",positive
14324,some reason just recently the app uninstalled itself or somehow or another it got uninstalled and I haven't been able to receive any updates or any calendar events for the last couple weeks,positive
14325,Have difficulty trying to set multiple appts for the same time on different days... Too complicated! Just want to input what days of the week i want the appt for.,positive
14326,I like this app. It's very useful.,positive
14327,My primary app for all my calendar needs. It works well. The pro version makes my life easier. Ild however give it a 5 star if i could put photos up directly into the calendar instead of loading it up as a link,positive
14328,Google assistant reminders do not populate ...will this be addressed soon ?,positive
14329,Good app. Looses my long term appointments now and then.,positive
14330,"Dear Team! I've been using this app since ages and I'm mostly satisfied but with Android 10 I lost the pop-up notification feature in the app. How can I restore it? Without pop-up notifications, only 4 stars. 😔 Thanks in advance! Reaction for the developer's comment: Even if I click on the notification in the status bar, it doesn't open pop-up but the event itself. And anyhow, pop-up notification is crucial for me, otherwise I simply miss the notifications from the calendar. Any ETA? 😔",positive
14331,"Excellent calendar, worth the upgrade!",positive
14332,"When I have open appointment and switch to different task, lost all unsaved changes. Missing me that open appointment is not listed in taskmanager as running task.",positive
14333,"I'm not sure, but I keep getting these little hidden files in download folder but I believe they're from the calendar. I haven't checked since the update. But I do use this app every day especially for the widgets and the customization. You can get lost in it, but I'd rather have the option than not.",positive
14334,Does everything it says it does. I use it on my phone and my tablet for 5 years now. Wish I there was a desktop edition to sync with it. And would be nice if there were saved searches. Seems like that would be easy to implement and so helpful for the users!,positive
14335,Good,positive
14336,"Amazing app, helps me organise different tasks and events with colour codes. Wish there was a notes page and a timetable so I could keep everything in one place!",positive
14337,"Very good, if a little hard to navigate. Would recommend.",positive
14338,"Great app. Had a quirk pop up last year, but historically best user interface, synced well, and wonderful functionality!",positive
14339,"Very good, been using for a few years now. The synch function is temperamental lately, perhaps an update changed something.",positive
14340,Find this a great app. Full diary views. To do lists and appointments can be on home screen. I have it on both my tablet and phone. Only problem I find is that sometimes it stop syncing.,positive
14341,Keeps all meetings organized. Great app!,positive
14342,Nice app,positive
14343,Overall good and works well. Syncs with google calendar and is a little easier to work with.,positive
14344,Синхронизация не работает,positive
14345,I wish there was a task manager. Only reason for 1 star drop. Otherwise this app is working great for me.,positive
14346,"This calendar application is fantastic and it is very easy to use. The best thing about it is that you can set multiple events and reminders. It's great that it has up to 5 reminders that you can set, for an event that you've made. There's also a custom setting for setting reminders to any specific time of your choosing. I'm also glad that it doesn't have autocorrect. There are convenient weekly monthly and yearly views to choose from. Great calendar application! I highly recommended it!",positive
14347,"Brilliant app. Would be great if attachments were supported too, but this is the best calendar app by a mile for my many calendars. Also - if you don't like ads, buy the bloody thing! Developers aren't charities, and i'm fairly sure you wouldnt do your job for nothing! Don't be cheap dudes.",positive
14348,"Everything is ideally pinpointed. There is instant access to tabbed features. It is a smooth and seamless system for organizing at a glance significant business network dates, meetings, holidays. It is a good tool for accessing daily activity reminders. I highly recommend this portal.",positive
14349,"I've tried other calendars, and I just love the layout. If only the widget layout can be changed when first opened. But it shows everything I need very easily. I can share my calendar with other people. I can change the colors. Another recommendation is to gain more colors for the appointments. :) Overall, super happy. Will not be choosing another calendar!",positive
14350,"It has been six months since my purchase of pro version of this app and I am writing this review as gratitude to the developers. Though, many of my favorite features have been added to default Google calender app, this one still is my default. The diversity and configurability of widgets has been of particular help to me in managing my personal and professional tasks. Another feature that I had used extensively is feature of repeated tasks, that have helped me in forming few good habits.",positive
14351,"I don't often buy apps above the basic level, but Business Calendar (and now Business Calendar 2) has helped me keep track of appointments so well for so long that I did. I've now had premium for almost a year & still thoroughly enjoy the added functionality & appreciate that the app is fully functional (albeit with some added time required in some cases) at the free level. Thanks for such a great app, & please make this app for iPhone too so my partner & I can use the same calendar app!",positive
14352,"I truly, literally, honestly would not be able to keep track of my life without this app. I have seven calendars and a task list synced to my device. I'm able to color code each calendar and appointments within those calendars, plus add emojis if I need an appointment to ""pop."" The android widget is fantastic (mine is set as my home screen so I always see what's coming up). Cannot recommend this app more highly. I would give 50 stars if the option was available.",positive
14353,"I have come to absolutely love this app! I have used it's beautiful widget playform on my last two or three devices for years! It is such an easy and awesome way for me to bring all my calendar scheduling together. There was an initial learning curve to it at the start, but once I got the hang of it it became so quick and easy!!! 😸 Amazing app guys! Glad I bought it.",positive
14354,"Review Update: the scheduling function I wanted has been included at some point in the past (which I did not know as I stopped looking for it long ago.) So... I am now pleased and revising my rating! Original Review: This app is good but I do not understand why they do not create a way to make a recurring (annual) event for, say, the 3rd Thursday in July. One can only create recurring events on the same DATE weekly, monthly, annually. That is not how many events are scheduled in the real world.",positive
14355,"I have used the app for many years and loved it. Within the last several months, it no longer syncs seamlessly with my Google calendar. Specifically, organizing tasks has become very gitchy. If you are looking for a calendar app and don't mind it not syncing with your Google calendar on your desktop then it's a great app. Unfortunately I'd really like it to sync.",positive
14356,"The simple customization of which calendars are showing with bars at the bottom of the screen is handy, and the widget with a customized compact agenda has been part of my home screens for years. The previous and current versions are 2 of the best app purchases I've made and certainly the most regularly used along with Nine. This shows my Nine (Exchange) calendars with no problems.",positive
14357,"Great app, been using it for years. Have been using the paid version for a long time and expect to be so for the foreseeable future. It has great syncing capabilities with my online calendar and all my other devices plus it allows me to share individual events to an individual or a group and the repeating events Works in every situation I can think of",positive
14358,"I've tried different calendar apps for a few years now and this is the one that I have decided to keep for the longest time. The monthly view is very neat, event creation offers a lot of option, and colors are easy om the eyes, too.",positive
14359,"Outstanding. I have relied on this app for years. The customization of the design colours for the calendar widget is a massive pro, as it keeps with my phone's aesthetics. The learning curve is a little steep in some cases, but the capabilities and look are worth it. With multiple reminder notifications, ability to include emojis, different colour options for calendar entries and design layout & much more, this is an indispensable app in my arsenal. Added colour options would be my one request.",positive
14360,"Just upgraded to Android 10. Re-evaluating. So far so good. Though pop ups are gone due to Android 10 architecture, I don't miss them. Reminders are now handled through the Android Notifications platform. Thankfully, the multiple reminders feature still works; I personally think this is the most important feature that makes this app better than stock calendar apps and even MS Outlook.",positive
14361,"Nice app if you have tons of calendars from different accounts and still want to be able to see a selected subset of them. A bit annoying with the pro version advertisement as of recently. Please, let add a feature to remove the tasks panel, I don't use it and can't resize it. It takes 1/3 of the day view.",positive
14362,I searched for quite some time to find a calendar app that my wife and I could share. Business Calendar is an excellent solution. We have it installed on our phones and tablets and all are in sync. No more asking what she is doing today. Thanks BC team.,positive
14363,"Listen, this is a great tool. Take the time to learn how to use it. It will do great things for you. If you are like me and value your time, productivity, and efficiency... Use this app. As an android user, I keep my agenda view along with all my tasks and lists as a widget to the left of my home screen. I keep my calendar view to the right. Quick, clean, efficient.",positive
14364,Took me soooooo long to find a calendar app where the reminders actually pop up OVER what I'm don't and bother me! I've been using this app for about a year now and it's a true life saver. I run a business and have 7 kids. I have between 10-20 reminders every day. This app truly works amazingly - not like others that failed to remind me and I was screwing things up all the time! Loooooove business calendar!,positive
14365,"Integrative calendar! I've been using this for a few years now. It combines multiple accounts, syncs fast, and the widgets are really flexible. One suggestion to the Devs is putting in an automatic ""Do Not Disturb"" option so you can be certain your phone won't ring during an event.",positive
14366,"Just realized that my purchase license is back -- it's Premium again now. Thank You very much and I do appreciate it. So, Dev., you deserve my 5 stars rating back. • This lovely App gets better and better on every update and runs flawlessly in Android 10. Now I can reuse it for my daily assistance. Again, a Big Thank! 🍷🙂👍🏻",positive
14367,"For years I didn't like digital calendars. They didn't offer me the overview I liked of physical calendars and notebooks. I was very sceptical of digital ones and their cumbersome features and options - writing something down with a pen seemed sooo much quicker and more direct. Then I saw a friend using Business Calendar and immediately I was intuitively drawn to its good overview of events, simple access to features and quick but precise 'taking a note'/'making an entry'.",positive
14368,awesome Not awesome. Just got a new phone. Doesn't trasnfer most of my events and tasks!!!! This has to improve. I love this app enough to take my tune to recreate my events BUT if this isn't fixed by the time I need a new phone.... bye bye Business Calendar. .... and I think I even PAID for the upgraded version! I see red!,positive
14369,"The best. Extremely easy toggle view/hide of your different calendars direct from the month view, ability to create new Google calendars (which you can't do on standard Google calendar), exceptional customization so the app/widget can always match your phones theme, etc etc. Took me about an hour to decide 100% that I will purchase pro, if for no other reason than to say thanks, but the features and look are amazing",positive
14370,"the last update is great. but I find the search function needs to improve, I prefer like the old BCPro, or like the samsung stock calendar. I use very often the search funtion, and when I need it I have to go to the samsung stock app. I prefer that in search all events with the key words should be displayed instant, not needing to ask for past of future years... that would make this app really 5 stars thanks",positive
14371,Literally used this app for the last 4 years. Love it. It does way more than any of the calendar apps on the market. I would recommend to any one. Secret feature: you can privately link contacts to tasks and appointments so you can easily have their info on hand.,positive
14372,Excellent interface with a variety of easy to use options. I like the clear colourful month view with enough written information on screen to see what each day has recorded without having to tap on each individual day to view information. Much better than other calendars I've tried.,positive
14373,"Literally the only app I found where the ""today"" widget shows only what is happening... today. Every other one will show the next couple of tasks, even if they're weeks out. Didn't know that was a ludicrously ridiculous request... but apparently it is, so thank you.",positive
14374,"I've used this app since it first came out. I've not seen Any errors or bugs. It is very, very easy to use, syncs with google calendar flawlessly (and has more info and can be used offline)! I've used it to synch with friends google calender.",positive
14375,"Actually a very handy app to use for agenda views. However what I would love to see is an option to have the agenda filter on the widget. Not a complaint, more just a suggestion for improvement.",positive
14376,I like this business calender as I can colour code the information I enter on a daily basis it makes it easy to check back on my enters and also notifications for up coming events I also like the way it learns form my input and offers suggestions I probably don't use it to its full potential but it caters for my needs and I am grateful that I use it thank you,positive
14377,"Amazing app. Very helpful in planning your business. Very nice feature that you can add something and put it on repeat (every day, every month, certain day...) Highly recommend, it will help to make you business and life more easy.",positive
14378,"Rarely taking the time to write a review but on this one it's absolutely worth it. Was looking for a calendar app that has some powerfull widgets to bring anything you need straight to the Homescreen and it just nails it. -Straight forward, no nonsense user experience -propper column calendar with tasks IN ONE widget -slick, highly customisable design -Syncs instantly It's been a straight up game changer for me so far and went premium - thanks a lot developing and maintaining this app!",positive
14379,"Very easy to use. I have the free version. Connects with my Google calendar and I share with my partner. I do have to manually sync through, as it doesn't update automatically very well. Overall, very happy with this app.",positive
14380,Absolutely love the app. First ever 5 star 🌟 rating and we'll deserved. I was looking for a widget that gave me the weekly schedule and this was spot on. No issues whatsoever so far and the UI is user-friendly too. 10/10 would recommend,positive
14381,"Love this app!! The template feature for take and events saves me do much time. I also love the ability to view calendars and groups on the fly, as well as zoom in and out to view a customized number of days. Great app.",positive
14382,"I have this app for 3+ years and still think it is a great app. I bought the full version after some time but the free version is great too. Easy, initiative, visually pleasing and reliable.",positive
14383,"The app does not allow to switch from monthly view to agenda with one touch only. I have to slide the page, find agenda in the list and then can switch. Google calendar does this only by touching the top of the page. Can you make this happen in the next update?",positive
14384,"I am a project support officer and administrator, calendars are one of my main tools every day. And business calendar is definitely my favourite one. Neat visualisation of all information required when you juggle multiple calendars. Let's you add, move, sync, colour code. No functionality issues ever.",positive
14385,"Have had this app for sometime and find it does everything I need both as a retail manager and my home life. Able to customize to suit individual needs, no hesitation in recommending.",positive
14386,"Great calendar for how I want my information displayed. Tried most of the calendar apps and this one was the only one I immediately liked and did not really need to ""learn"". For reference I use Thunderbird as my computer email application.",positive
14387,"Coupled with sectograph (just the best widget for me) and in sync with the different calendars I need, this is the perfect app. The customization and simple look makes everything clear. If there was a desktop app as well I'd get it too.",positive
14388,App worked well for me from the start- but it took a while to learn how to utilize many of the features. My close friends chide me because I add so much to my calendar - but the ability to add reminders keeps me on track.,positive
14389,I chose this calendar for its widgets which are the best among all the apps I tried. This combined with fine controls are the reasons I haven't looked back for several years now.,positive
14390,"Amazing app! I love that you can slide from one day to several days as you please. Very user friendly, pretty colors and no bugs. Also, adding an event is simple and fast. Kudos to the developers.",positive
14391,"Love this app, would love to have the ability to have a desktop version that sync'd with my phone. Maybe add this ability to permium users? Overall very pleased with this app. keeps a busy schduled organized, especially where multiple calendars are involved.",positive
14392,"Great app. Love everything about it, especially the multi select option. Would love to see the task/tool bar at the bottom rather than the top, it would make one hand operation a lot easier.",positive
14393,"This is a great calendar app and it also connect to your other Calendar apps, like your Google, Microsoft, Samsung and so on. Keeping you in touch with every calendar that you have on your phone.",positive
14394,This is a superb organisational app! It met.my.needs when I was hunting around to replace another to do app that failed with an upgrade. I would recommend this to anyone.,positive
14395,"I've had this app for over 3 years, and paid a very small price for it, and I couldn't be happier. Quick setup, reminders the way you want them, and easy on the eyes when you change colors to your liking.",positive
14396,"Very nice agenda widget. Also supports basic ICS import, saved me a couple of times. Had some problems deleting tasks, but might have been a glitch of my phone. But the look is great, one of the best out there",positive
14397,That's a great app. I have suggestion which would make this app perfect for me. Make option to delay all today's events for 1h (or any other period of time) great anyway,positive
14398,"Best calendar app ive ever used. Has a lot of preferences to suite your needs. But I would like to suggest if possible, for the all day events to be able to change their order sequence. That would be awesome!",positive
14399,LOVE THIS APP. I use this to consolidate multiple work and personal calendars in one view. I love the ability to manage appearance and notifications for each independently - super helpful in maintain work-life boundaries.,positive
14400,Very helpful to have reminders and important details at your fingertips. I wish there was a way to have it synch with an app or program on your computer.,positive
14401,"I love this App, just a question for future thought, the native Samsung Calendar app (S8) when you tap a day you can easily swipe left or right via a box to easily show what appointments you have, any chance for someday a L/R on Business Calendar??",positive
14402,I love the ability to combine calendars and task lists. It is very customizable and easy to use. I would love an option to have it on my computer as well and be able to sync them together. There are many widgets and they are very customizable as well.,positive
14403,"Intuitive, fast, easy. Only my custom colors get messed up every once in a while between B.C. and Google, but I don't know who's fault that is.",positive
14404,Absolutely essential to my law practice! Full featured yet extremely intuitive to use. Syncs perfectly with Google Calendar. One of my earliest & smartest app purchases as soon as I took the Android plunge.,positive
14405,"I have had this app for years now. It is the best calendar app I have used. I like how well it integrates with contacts, and how I am now able to attach files. Definitely makes my life easier.",positive
14406,I have used for 3 or so years. It has served me well. So far. :). So far it is one of very few apps that has never crashed...( The so far is Murphy's law),positive
14407,LOVE this calendar!! I don't know how I remembered anything I had to do before!! The notifications are SO helpful as you can dismiss or snooze for 5 minutes to days! Highly recommend!!,positive
14408,Works great. Looks great. Excellent features. Everything I need in a calendar widget. I don't actually use the app,positive
14409,"Love this app. Been using it for a few years. I have my personal, business, and family calendars all in one view. The widget is great for quickly viewing my agenda.",positive
14410,Good set of features. Works well. Only wish I could display tasks or reminders on the Calendar without a time duration.,positive
14411,Excellent! Very versatile. I like being able to set multiple reminders and the location.,positive
14412,I've been using the app for more than a year and it's a real thing! Very functional and customizable in many different ways. I simply can't use another calendar app since I started using it,positive
14413,"The best to-do and calendar combined app I have come across, and worth the fee. Have looked at many on Android and iOS, and this is the only one that does what I want.",positive
14414,Best app for calendars. It's complete in almost every way possible. Made my calendar app for life because of the customization power you have!,positive
14415,Great Calendar and planning app. Easy to use and get the job done. Well worth the extra money for the Pro version. I enjoy the extra theme's. I recommend this over Google Calendar.,positive
14416,"Integrates Google calendar well, has a clean interface and easy to add one time and recurring events. I've tried many and keep coming back to Business Calendar.",positive
14417,Coming from 7 years of windows phone usage. I was desperately looking for a widget to show daily agenda on home screen. This is the far better one,positive
14418,Best planner ever bought the pro edition...it's easy to use and has many convenient functions like tracking overdue tasks.,positive
14419,"I spent a long time looking at and trying different calendar apps, and this was the only one I could find that had the functionality that I wanted. I haven't looked back since! I highly recommend it.",positive
14420,Very good UI. I really like the way it lets me manage views and multi task with my email. I paid for the pro version.,positive
14421,Been very happy with this app. I love the widget and calendar view that show the names of the events in calendar view. Very helpful!,positive
14422,Very pleased with the product! I do however have one suggestion: possibility to pick location directly from the maps would be nice.,positive
14423,I love the ease of use to advance options. I get to tailor the appearance and easily create reminder template for future use.,positive
14424,"Excellent app, have it synced with about 8 calendars so I can get everything in one place. It works - I wish everything in the App world worked so well.",positive
14425,This calendar app is amazing! It can do so many things the other calendar apps can't huge and rich feature set. Very reliable. 10 stars!,positive
14426,"Paid for pro since I use this app almost exclusively. All my other calendars are integrated into it. I use it daily for events, tasks, and reminders.",positive
14427,I have been using this calendar for years and have decided to upgrade partially to support the developers and partially for the additional functionality. I have no intention on ever switching my calendar application,positive
14428,Fantastic app! It has so many options to adjust. I love the widget on phone screen. My husband has started to use it as well. Thank you!,positive
14429,Love it! Works very well and isn't inundated with ads. I don't mind an ad here and there and this app has it perfected,positive

14433,I've been using this as a replacement for the default calendar for years. I love it. Very full featured.,positive

14494,Easy to use,positive

14542,"It has been six months since my purchase of pro version of this app and I am writing this review as gratitude to the developers. Though, many of my favorite features have been added to default Google calender app, this one still is my default. The diversity and configurability of widgets has been of particular help to me in managing my personal and professional tasks. Another feature that I had used extensively is feature of repeated tasks, that have helped me in forming few good habits.",positive
14543,Great app.,positive
14544,"If you want to organize your day/week, this is the app for you.",positive
14545,I love the drag and drop feature,positive
14546,The reason I am giving this 1 star is because of its unreliability! I purchased this app for my android phone and my Mac desktop. It is very frustrating that the same app on my Mac IS NOT updating with my phone!!! This app is absolutely useless to me when I cannot see events that I have put in in real time even after I refreshing the app. Very disappointing! And kinda pissed off that I paid good money for this app!,negative
14547,Cannot get it to work on my Huawei P20. I have tried 3 times and cannot get it to sign in. It looks like it works fine on my iPad because I can sign up and get in but on my phone I am unable to do either. I needed something that I could use on both devices but am unable to get into in ob my phone,negative
14548,I loaded the app on to my Amazon Fire. It will only display horizontally and I dont have the export option even though I have the Premium subscription. I can't export my Task list either.,negative
14549,"Extremely Disappointed. I had been a faithful user of this app and loved it. Then all of sudden everything changed. There is no cloud support. The tabs option is gone. There is no interface with established tasks list. I have tried and tried to use. I contacted support and they replied that due to streamlining the app it has a completely new appearance. I had uninstalled this app, however I felt I needed to write thos review. After I finish this, uninstalling this app. Useless to me.",negative
14550,"I use to love this app. It is the perfect organizer with great features. However for the last month+ it barely opens. I am lucky if it will actually open twice a day. The app will say not responding, opens to a black page, or doesn't do anything but freeze my phone momentarily. My life is saved into this app so I am so frustrated!!",negative
14551,NOTE TO SELF::: The demo version of this app is totally useless - so there is no way of knowing if this product will be able to meet my needs BEFORE paying for the premium version. I'll find another way to get my needs met. I'm sure there are other products available for free that would do the same things. Since I'm not allowed to testdrive all the bells and whistles - I am passing this app over. No thanks. UNINSTALLING.,negative
14552,"Too many ads, and it doesn't automatically save your work. Also, everytime I exit, and reopen it, it brings me to a different page than I was on.",negative
14553,I was really excited about this app but when I went to create an account it did not work. I tried logging in with my google account but it still didn't work. I am very disappointed,negative
14554,Doesn't look like the pictures at all. Exact same layout as your phone's calendar. Now new settings etc. Waste of time app.,negative
14555,"This app used to be great. Now it is garbage. A few months ago it started doubling a few tasks - no problem, I just delete the extras. Now I get 5 to 10 copies of every task I delete. It is worthless.   I can't forget the wait times to open the app, up to 8 minutes of staring at a black screen.   Oh, and the fact that in the past week or two it started giving me ads even though I have been using the paid version for years already.   I let them know a couple weeks ago and got no response.",negative
14556,"I liked this app, even paid for it, but uninstalled it today due to weird behavior. I see two other reviews here with a similar problem. The app will periodically launch itself, but it's just a black screen, and it creates a copy of my home screen - looks the same but frozen until I hit the close button, then the copy scrolls away and I can again use my phone. Just odd.",negative
14557,"I have used this app for years. I have always paid for the premium version. At first, it was my favorite app, but it has gotten steadily worse. Now it is very glitchy. It closes randomly and typically takes up to three minutes to open which is very embarrassing when I'm trying to set an appointment with a customer. It also randomly unchecks completed tasks and reverts to older versions of my schedule. The developers are uncaring and blame my phone (Note 8). I'm looking for a new app.",negative
14558,"I tried adding the pro for $7.99 because I thought you could set daily reminders by just marking repeat daily it doesn't do that or any of the things I was hoping for, I have had it less than 24 hours and would like a refund, I have sent emails asking for help and haven't received anything back so I just want my money back and this app gone!",negative
14559,"I have had this app for 2 years and absolutely loved it, after an update it would cut on automatically and freeze my phone. I would have to hit the open apps and close it before I could do anything with my phone. I have emailed and explained what it was doing, and I get am email wanting more explanation, so I did. several days later I get an email that wants a video showing. I don't think this will get fixed i paid for the pro version and i will not renew",negative
14560,I thought upgrading and paying the $8 fee would allow me to use all of the functions of this app. It does not. I Haven't been able to sync any of my devices . Absolutely will not let me add an event. This was a waste of time and money. If I can't add my schedule on my lap top version then there's no point to this app. Plus there's no support or anyone to contact to help trouble shoot or credit me back .,negative
14561,the app opens it self up whenever it wants to display an ad but the screen remains the same but i cant press anything. so it just opens up in the background all day long to display ads and make money when im not even using the app. this feature is ridiculous and it started happening every 5 minutes as opposed to every now and then so i just deleted the app.,negative
14562,Got a new phone and app now won't allow me to hit sign in button. Customer service is very slow to respond to help. Love the app for last 2 / 3 yrs but not being able to use now is not worth my $$$ paid for it & to think it just renewed,negative
14563,"In order to actually use the app as a planner, you have to pay money. Very misleading and dissapointing.",negative
14564,It won't allow you to create an account with e-mail address and password. Why give you the option but then doesn't work when you use it. If not resolved within a week uninstalling app.,negative
14565,This basically is just a purple version of Google calendar. It has the almost exact same layout as Google calendar without any extra features. I wanted to use this as planner for school seperate from my calendar but there was no way to have it not sync with Google. Don't bother getting this app just use calendar directly.,negative
14566,"Was great at first, but a new bug makes it so that every time I unlock my phone i have to press the “home” button twice to be able to use my phone at all. I know that it is this app causing the problem as when I click on the recently used apps tab after the bug occurs, this app is always the only one shown. I will have to uninstall now because of this.",negative
14567,"Lmao this app is so bad. Setting events is a pain, time zones don't work, the from time and to time of an event don't work. If you trust this app for your planning. I'm sure you'd go mad because of missing important meetings due to wrong time setting. Just use Microsoft Outlook etc and pay for it. This one is a waste of time",negative
14568,don't bother with this planner app. there are lots of other apps that do the same thing. this app has intrusive ads thats pop up at random. if you close the app and open a different app planner pro will open a pop up on the new app your using. seriously don't even bother with this BS,negative
14569,Can't sign in. And there are reviews from October saying the same. So... No improvement over months of having the same issue.,negative
14570,Doesn't work offline. requires internet and information. So not personal as it is over the internet. Sorry did not get past first screen requiring sign up... UNINSTALLED.,negative
14571,This app is not worth the $6 a year. Poorly developed with several glitches.,negative
14572,Could not get the app to save event time properly. All I wanted was to put a due date between 11:50 p.m. and 11:59 p.m. on a certain day. WOULD NOT do it. The app kept automatically changing my times. That's annoying enough for me to ditch it and move on.,negative
14573,"could be better. pls fix the 'repeat' setting where i could accually pick the exact date and time. for example i have to study during mondays, tuesdays and fridays at 8 pm. the app isn't very specific about it deeming it useless to me. hoping for a better update.",negative
14574,I can't get a refund and the app doesn't work. Google play is zero help and I can't reach a developer! I've been robbed.,negative
14575,"I have been using this for more than a year now, it was great, this is where i jot down notes on my classes and meetings, but this new update may have a bug i cant access it even with the correct pin i have entered Pls fix this issue, thanks",negative
14576,App became unusable with 11/06/18 update. Now the app takes 30-45 to open up after I click it and then I'm get an annoying ad that plays that I can't close for another 5-10 seconds. I'll be finding a new calendar app.,negative
14577,"This app sucks if you dont have the Pro version. I only had for a few min and couldn't do more than add a task. I tried to add an event, and wanted to sync chromebook to cell but it wouldn't let me.",negative
14578,This is a great planner but I'm really annoyed that having previously paid for the Pro version I am now expected to pay an annual fee!!!,negative
14579,ANNOYED paid for this years ago PAID full version and used it and recommended it! Now I am asked to pay YEARLY to remove ads! what joke! I paid for full add free version already and there is nothing new to justify the yearly purchase...,negative
14580,I received a notice from planner pro this morning when I went to schedule some appts. it notifies me I cannot use the app until payment received. iI checked my bank and payment was made on 01/26/2019. I will be cancelling as unable to use.,negative
14581,I would give 5 if bug is fixed. It automatically opens showing black and unresponsive app pop up when it is not actually opened. Please fix. This is for Samsung S10e.,negative
14582,Will not accept passcode after today's update. Have been a paid user for some time and NEED my info back. Please fix and I will update my review. Useless to me until resolved.,negative
14583,Infested with ads now. Downloaded to specifically view one calendar and set it so but it automatically syncs my Samsung and gmail calendars automatically every time I open it.,negative
14584,it's simple enough to set up a task or event..but not once has it reminded me as set to. so looking for one that will.,negative
14585,NOVEMBER updates broke a lot of functionalities. Please fix guys. - choosing alert notification sounds - ability to close off tasks on notification bar - lost full purchase info,negative
14586,Does not integrate well across multiple cross-platform devices; more upsetting to discover this after paying for the app.,negative
14587,This app launches itself with an invisible overlay over my home screen. That is EXTREMELY suspect behavior and therefore uninstalling.,negative
14588,Shows annoying full screen ads that pop up from time to time!,negative
14589,"Rollback, right after editing.. pls fix this!",negative
14590,"I liked it at first, even paid for it too but now it won't sync across my devices so I need to find something else that will",negative
14591,Amazingly useful app with horrible glitches every week when all checked tasks become undone and overdue and default calendar changed by itself.,negative
14592,Closing and crashing when adding tasks and project. Support answering but doesn't help.,negative
14593,Can't get account created. Tried linking facebook and straight account creation... will not let me progress past sign in page.,negative

would have recommended it before all this happened but not any more",negative
14641,"A negative experience.  I wasn't using it and forgot about it until it was renewing.  I didn't port it over to a new phone and it seems  you can't cancel the app except through the app.  This means I would have to install it on my new phone, give it permission to access my information, then cancel the subscription and uninstall it.

14642,"Don't bother unless you pay them($7.99yr) they don't offer a

14650,The reason I am giving this 1 star is because of its unreliability! I purchased this app for my android phone and my Mac desktop. It is very frustrating that the same app on my Mac IS NOT updating with my phone!!! This app is absolutely useless to me when I cannot see events that I have put in in real time even after I refreshing the app. Very disappointing! And kinda pissed off that I paid good money for this app!,negative
14651,Cannot get it to work on my Huawei P20. I have tried 3 times and cannot get it to sign in. It looks like it works fine on my iPad because I can sign up and get in but on my phone I am unable to do either. I needed something that I could use on both devices but am unable to get into in ob my phone,negative

14653,I was really excited about this app but when I went to create an account it did not work. I tried logging in with my google account but it still didn't work. I am very disappointed,negative
14654,"Rollback, right after editing.. pls fix this!",negative
14655,I can't get a refund and the app doesn't work. Google play is zero help and I can't reach a developer! I've been robbed.,negative
14656,Lousy app,negative
14657,I loaded the app on to my Amazon Fire. It will only display horizontally and I dont have the export option even though I have the Premium subscription. I can't export my Task list either.,negative
14658,"In order to actually use the app as a planner, you have to pay money. Very misleading and dissapointing.",negative
14659,"I use to love this app. It is the perfect organizer with great features. However for the last month+ it barely opens. I am lucky if it will actually open twice a day. The app will say not responding, opens to a black page, or doesn't do anything but freeze my phone momentarily. My life is saved into this app so I am so frustrated!!",negative
14660,Would not let me create a log in.,negative

I just spent an hour deleting and checking off tasks from my to do list and everytime I think Im done, they show back up in triplicate!! Everything I changed IS STILL THERE AFTER AN HOUR!!!

14671,Piece of poo,negative
14672,NOTE TO SELF::: The demo version of this app is totally useless - so there is no way of knowing if this product will be able to meet my needs BEFORE paying for the premium version. I'll find another way to get my needs met. I'm sure there are other products available for free that would do the same things. Since I'm not allowed to testdrive all the bells and whistles - I am passing this app over. No thanks. UNINSTALLING.,negative
14673,Completed tasks continue to reappear,negative
14674,"Lmao this app is so bad. Setting events is a pain, time zones don't work, the from time and to time of an event don't work. If you trust this app for your planning. I'm sure you'd go mad because of missing important meetings due to wrong time setting. Just use Microsoft Outlook etc and pay for it. This one is a waste of time",negative
14675,It won't allow you to create an account with e-mail address and password. Why give you the option but then doesn't work when you use it. If not resolved within a week uninstalling app.,negative
14676,Got a new phone and app now won't allow me to hit sign in button. Customer service is very slow to respond to help. Love the app for last 2 / 3 yrs but not being able to use now is not worth my $$$ paid for it & to think it just renewed,negative

14690,"Was great at first, but a new bug makes it so that every time I unlock my phone i have to press the “home” button twice to be able to use my phone at all. I know that it is this app causing the problem as when I click on the recently used apps tab after the bug occurs, this app is always the only one shown. I will have to uninstall now because of this.",negative
14691,the app opens it self up whenever it wants to display an ad but the screen remains the same but i cant press anything. so it just opens up in the background all day long to display ads and make money when im not even using the app. this feature is ridiculous and it started happening every 5 minutes as opposed to every now and then so i just deleted the app.,negative
14692,"I have used this app for years. I have always paid for the premium version. At first, it was my favorite app, but it has gotten steadily worse. Now it is very glitchy. It closes randomly and typically takes up to three minutes to open which is very embarrassing when I'm trying to set an appointment with a customer. It also randomly unchecks completed tasks and reverts to older versions of my schedule. The developers are uncaring and blame my phone (Note 8). I'm looking for a new app.",negative

14702,"I liked this app, even paid for it, but uninstalled it today due to weird behavior. I see two other reviews here with a similar problem. The app will periodically launch itself, but it's just a black screen, and it creates a copy of my home screen - looks the same but frozen until I hit the close button, then the copy scrolls away and I can again use my phone. Just odd.",negative
14703,"I have had this app for 2 years and absolutely loved it, after an update it would cut on automatically and freeze my phone. I would have to hit the open apps and close it before I could do anything with my phone.

I don't think this will get fixed i paid for the pro version and i will not renew",negative
14704,ANNOYED paid for this years ago PAID full version and used it and recommended it! Now I am asked to pay YEARLY to remove ads! what joke! I paid for full add free version already and there is nothing new to justify the yearly purchase...,negative

It is worthless.   I can't forget the wait times to open the app, up to 8 minutes of staring at a black screen.   Oh, and the fact that in the past week or two it started giving me ads even though I have been using the paid version for years already.   I let them know a couple weeks ago and got no response.",negative
14712,Cannot log in on other devices.,negative
14713,I received a notice from planner pro this morning when I went to schedule some appts. it notifies me I cannot use the app until payment received. iI checked my bank and payment was made on 01/26/2019. I will be cancelling as unable to use.,negative

14715,Can't get account created. Tried linking facebook and straight account creation... will not let me progress past sign in page.,negative
14716,Could not get the app to save event time properly. All I wanted was to put a due date between 11:50 p.m. and 11:59 p.m. on a certain day. WOULD NOT do it. The app kept automatically changing my times. That's annoying enough for me to ditch it and move on.,negative
14717,Amazingly useful app with horrible glitches every week when all checked tasks become undone and overdue and default calendar changed by itself.,negative
14718,i hate it😠,negative
14719,I thought upgrading and paying the $8 fee would allow me to use all of the functions of this app. It does not. I Haven't been able to sync any of my devices . Absolutely will not let me add an event. This was a waste of time and money. If I can't add my schedule on my lap top version then there's no point to this app. Plus there's no support or anyone to contact to help trouble shoot or credit me back .,negative

14726,Who puts ads on a calendar?! Y'all that desperate for money smh.,negative
14727,Does not integrate well across multiple cross-platform devices; more upsetting to discover this after paying for the app.,negative

14731,App became unusable with 11/06/18 update. Now the app takes 30-45 to open up after I click it and then I'm get an annoying ad that plays that I can't close for another 5-10 seconds. I'll be finding a new calendar app.,negative
14732,Please fixed it. Why i can't login my passcode. Damnly. Alot of doc i ve save inside,negative

14738,No,negative
14739,It says you are downloading the pro version which is a complete lie.,negative
14740,This basically is just a purple version of Google calendar. It has the almost exact same layout as Google calendar without any extra features. I wanted to use this as planner for school seperate from my calendar but there was no way to have it not sync with Google. Don't bother getting this app just use calendar directly.,negative
14741,"I liked it at first, even paid for it too but now it won't sync across my devices so I need to find something else that will",negative
14742,Absolutely terrible customer service. They refused after several years to fix the 9.7 tablet aspect ratio. For a paying customer this is absolutely poor customer service has never work properly once don't buy those that run away,negative
14743,Could not even create a account,negative
14744,"A negative experience.  I wasn't using it and forgot about it until it was renewing.  I didn't port it over to a new phone and it seems  you can't cancel the app except through the app.  This means I would have to install it on my new phone, give it permission to access my information, then cancel the subscription and uninstall it.  Other apps on my phone with subscriptions I can cancel through Google Play.  Apparently not this one.",negative
14745,"Started my account with outlook and went to put it on my phone apparently 
forgot password so hit forgot password and it said I didn't have an account 
so I went back to my tablet and it told me the same thing. I even put a pin 
in my phone and the pin was right, but it had deleted everything all the 
same and told me again I didn't have an account after making another new 
one. This app would be great if it didn't delete everything all the time. I 
would have recommended it before all this happened but not any more",negative
14746,"It's useful but it doesn't fully sync the events, tasks, and notes between devices. It's a huge inconvenience. Besides that I still love the app.",negative
14747,Nice looking app albeit does not seem to sync with Google calendar and not cross platform. Certainly cannot do $15/yr.,negative
14748,"The interface is great and I love it overall; however, I'm giving it two Stars because it won't synchronize between my Samsung phone and Ipad, despite being the same account information for each. I emailed their support like about this, and they asked for my login info, but I never heard anything back. This is a huge inconvenience because I put a LOT into the version on my iPad, and I dont, and wont, do it twice for the same application. Once this is fixed I'll happily increase the rating.",negative
14749,"I have been using this for a while and found it to suit my needs well. I wanted something where I could see trasks and appointments in a daily view. This accomplished that goal in an easy to read and navigate format. However, there must have been a recent update that has made the ads ridiculously invasive to the point that I no longer want to use this app. I think I will start checking on alternate options.",negative
14750,"I loved this planner for several years with no issues. All of a sudden I can't launch the app or create/edit an event without getting a noisy, intrusive pop-up ads. I will be looking for a new option, possibly even just my stock calendar.",negative
14751,This is literally just another calendar app. Misleading calling it a planner. Smh. It's not even a good calendar. If you're hunting for a good planning app keep looking because this is definitely not it!!!,negative
14752,I was told to install Planner Pro instead of Planner Plus (which was what I already used) in order for my cell phone & iPad to sync. I have had at least 5 emails back & forth with the contact person but I still can't get my calendars linked using my email address as instructed. I guess I will have to go back to my Google calendar. I love the Planner Plus but need a calendar that syncs to both my cell and iPad.,negative
14753,"Eh. it's mediocre and really doesn't do anything your calendar app on your phone doesn't already do. I liked using the month widget until it just decided, on Jan 29, that the month of February no loger existed. I tried to look ahead to the month of Feb to see a preview from the widget but it kept going fron Jan to March. The only way to view Feb in the widget was to change the date to Feb in my phone. just went back to my phone's calendar app. Uninstalling.",negative

14757,i think I could really like this app. except I upgraded to paid and still have ads and the search function does not search notes. It will be hard to find info saved in notes if you cant search...,negative

My phone is crashing several times a day, when I remove the app it stops crashing. I hope there is a fix for this. It works just fine on my tablet, but not my phone. It's a great app due to its simplicity. I switched to another planner app today and will be requesting a refund.",negative
14769,"I made several repeating tasks that are supposed to be repeated weekly by the day of the week. They seem to just multiply and now the same 4 tasks will show up 3 times each on a single day. I can't edit the original repeating ones, I can only delete them individually on the day they show up several times. This is VERY annoying. This app was a waste of my money. I paid for the ability to make repeating tasks. I'm very disappointed.",negative
14770,"Was fine until the last couple of days when the layout turned squirrelly on my Android tablet.  Seems okay on my smart phone.  Still, I will not purchase full version unless the version for my tablet goes back to matching the screen layout on my cell.",negative
14771,"I've had this app for a few years, and it worked well until the last several months - it's gotten increasingly buggy and will do things like ""forget"" you checked off tasks as completed and re-list them as incomplete between closing and re-opening the app.  It also had been freezing more and more frequently, to the point where that happens at least once a day, and now I can't even load certain screens.  Because of this, I will not be renewing my subscription this year and will be using another app.",negative
14772,"Uninstalled when I saw the app wanted me to pay a subscription fee as ransom for my data, I never will.",negative

too much. I have about 20 of the same task for each day and it takes 
forever for me to delete the extra tasks.",negative

crock. I'll find another app 👋",negative

thought it would work but non of them did so that sucked",negative
14778,It sucks🖕🖕,negative
14779,I set weekly view in settings and for few days the app worked fine but today i tried to go back to months view and i tried to access settings but when i try to do that the app closes,negative
14780,"Widget is buggy - a task marked as completed in the app is displayed as overdue, and trying to tick it off in the widget takes me into edit mode. The proper app, when reopened, shows a blank inbox and revisiting the screen is required to populate it again. Poor punctuation (eg. ""28 Sep , 2017” - why the space before the comma) is not that big a deal, but also adds to the app not feeling very ""pro"".",negative

14782,"I really wanted to like this app, but it's just too buggy. Sometimes I open the app and it doesn't have the icons to switch views. Also the 12-hour formatting is really flawed. And the priority scale seems way too complex. High, medium, low should be enough for most people.",negative
14783,"I tried to explore it a little after downloading, I want something that will show me everything planned on the day I have notes on rather than me having to search if I do, i tend to forget due to busy schedules. I want automatic pop up, I'll keep playing with it, but so far dislike",negative
14784,Didn't get past not being able to use it in portrait mode.  I think I should be able to choose whether I need widespread view as in a spreadsheet or a portrait view to view a page of writing and this does not give me the option. I may end up using it this is only the second app that I have tried for organizing by used to be hand & ink written notebooks.,negative
14785,The app is great for the schedule but the tasks needs work . I should be able to schedule something to repeat every day but it doesn't allow for that option. And it doesn't always register the repeats. Had to pay for the yearly subscription to find out it doesnt even work. Stick with the free version. Least youre not wasting your money. Will have to try something else for my tasks. And the developer doesn't care.,negative
14786,"I think the free version of the app has some good capabilities, but lacks some functionality that I desire; functionality that I'm not sure exists in the paid version due to the lack of support for the product. I was unable to find where I could go to ask questions. Thus the 2 star rating",negative
14787,"Well, based on the description of this app and what I understood I would receive has not, lived up to its description. I hope the bugs will be worked out. I emailed for help more than 24 hours ago and have not received any response thus far.  It would be helpful to have a help and/or FAQ section to refer to. After only one day of using the app, I have encountered the following:  1. From calendar screen, + button does not give option for Project (only Event, Task, or Note).  I have the upgraded version.  2. Settings, General, Start with... is set for Day View, but shows month instead.  3. Help & Feedback only gives option to email for help. No option to search for help.  4. When deleting an item in a series comma I do not get the option to just delete the one occurrence.  Am I doing something wrong? Is there any help that I can expect to receive? I paid $4.99 for the upgraded version, and I am not at all happy. Busy people with crazy schedules need a reliable app.",negative
14788,"App is very buggy ! Week view is completely unusable - shows some events twice, and some not at all.  Also, it would be nice if there was an option, in month view, to see the names of the events without having to click on every day individually.  Fix this and you'll get 5 stars, but without that (especially week view!) the app is useless.",negative

14791,"With so many free calendar apps out there, there's just nothing in the free version of this one to make you choose it. The only feature that might set it apart from the competition is the project feature, but you have to pay to use it. Sure, you have the notes feature, but there are ways to accomplish the same thing in pretty much any other calendar, so I just can't see the point. Rather than pay for an upgrade to an app that's just ho-hum (the view isn't even very customizable), I'll be uninstalling.",negative
14792,It doesn't work well as a calander or any type of memo for me. I also didn't like the type of layout design they made it didn't fit with what the purpose of this app was said to do,negative
14793,I have questions that i would like to have answered and i have emailed numerous times with no reponse back. They say dont write negative reponses to this app without contacting us first. I did email for answers but no one will answer my questions. My questions are not bad for this app but the people behind this app are terrible business people. So this could be a great app but service is terrible. Which instead of getting 4 or 5 stars im giving 2 should be 1 but app is good the ones behind the app are bad just want to take peoples money and then laugh at us by not helping,negative

14949,"The app design looks nice, and has good features. This is a functional planner app. I can access the week view in the free version (though a prompt to upgrade to premium pops up), but tasks cannot be set as recurring in the free version. This is a main feature I'm looking for in a planner app. Also, the look of the app cannot be customized- stuck forever with that purple at the top of the screen. There are other free apps that include these things.",neutral
14950,"This is hands down the best personal planning app I've ever come across. That being said, it's basically unusable on Android. The view jumps to the top of the day's task list at random, making it easy to accidentally check off the wrong task. It takes minutes to load anything when you try to access the rest of the app through the back arrow at the top left. And, on occasion, tasks will duplicate themselves multiple times with different parameters. I use it on my iPad with no trouble at all.",neutral
14951,"There's a visible lag when scrolling left or right in day view, even in high end phones. Going back from a task edit screen without making any changes also asks (shows popup) whether you wish to save or discard changes, that popup is irritating. Otherwise an effective and the point app. Cheers!",neutral
14952,"I like how it allows me to set any number of reminders, minutes/hours/days/weeks in advance either by push notification or email. But many little bugs pepper this app. The calendar view will bug out and not map to the selected month from time to time. The location field tries to be smart by giving you a 'maps like' autocomplete, but this is annoying when you just want 'gym'. For some reason the first letter of an event name isn't registered by autocorrect, so 'Event' turns to 'venting'.",neutral

The down side is that the app did not sync... i have 2 device handphone and tablet both android... i have to update both device twice instead of once...

It also will not sound when I have reminders set for many different times.

15310,I am running this app on a Droid Turbo with stock  Lollipop installed.  The app has a very nice layout but unfortunately I find it to be very buggy.  It is impossible to create an event that includes Monday and the app can't import recurring events from Google calendar.  I have reported these to the developers and hope the app is cleaned up soon.,neutral

15320,Nice,neutral
15321,I haven't been using this very long and it's not as user friendly as the Calender that came on my last phone.  I wish instead of dots you can just see what you have entered for that day immediately without tapping on that day.  Otherwise it is easy to use and functional.,neutral

I just love using the week view seeing at one shot, time of events laid out in planner, including notes on that day with pics uploaded if needed. It sync with my AnyDo planner which has a calender.

15364,"Cool app, seems to have all I need at this point. My only 2c would be that 
the widget weekly view should have the option to see the 7 days ahead 
rather than the current week; if it's a Friday, I don't really care what I 
did on Monday, I wanna know what's happening next Monday",positive
15365,Just installed and am liking it so far. I do wish there was a way to disable the quotes and better utilize that space to see more of my actual calendar. Also sub tasks would be very useful. With those changes I might actually be able to downsize the apps I use.,positive
15366,"I would love this app so much more if part of the calendar wasn't obscured. 
I don't mind the week number or anything, I just wish I could see both it 
and the bottom of the calendar clearly.",positive

15373,"I really like this app - its a lovely interface, simple to use and very useful to have both tasks and notes with the calendar. Is there any possibility of adding a folder/tag/category function to the notes?  It would be so helpful - I make notes on a varietu of things as I go along, and its really useful to be able to store them by day, but it would also be great to be able to sort them by tags or folders. Anyway - just a suggestion. Otherwise a lovely app. Thanks :-)",positive
15374,A great app. I just downloaded it and I already love it. The only issue here is slight ui bugs. November 2017 gets covered up by the tabs at the top and on the day section the date runs into the calender layout. Again great app but those errors make the app look less professional. I would recommend rescaling the fragments so they fit better on the page as well as the toolbar. Definitely am recommending to friends though,positive
15375,"Almost perfect. The only changes that would be helpful is a quicker way to switch from the week view to the task list. And i would like to see my tasks as a list by default instead of clicking on the task categories. Also I wish that you had a rollover option for tasks, I have yet to find an app that had this: basically I wish when I create a task I could choose if the task carries forward to the next day if not completed or not.",positive
15376,I really like this app and ised to love it until there was an update that was stopping me from using it without upgrading. If i had to pay a one time purchase thats one thing but an annual fee?? Give me a break. $5 for a planner app is reasonable if you use it all of the time but not every year. Yall are greedy.,positive
15377,The essence and notion of this application is not just to define activities from day to day basis but to remind us that its really not about perfection... Its about progress... This application teaches us not just to address holistically in our commitment and time management but also push drastically at the same time our attitude towards commitments.. Senior Project Engineer here... It really helps alot... Thank you.,positive
15378,I just downloaded this.  The free version was definitely useful but I went ahead and got the paid version because I wanted to use the repetitive tasks and weekly planner as well.  I definitely think this will be worth the purchase.,positive
15379,"Great App, but would be good if you could edit tasks after you've written them.  Also would be good if it could have, a daily 'things to do list'on.calendar ,which could be ticked off alongside projects /tasks.",positive
15380,"This app is great! But i have some suggestions that would even better improve the quality of using the app. for example, something like being able to edit the tasks widgets to show 'due soon' instead of just tasks for that day for even better planning.",positive

15384,"I went a got the full subscription and I really like it so far, but I wish you could download it for your PC as well.",positive
15385,This app is great but maybe let us tick task we completed from widget as it's annoying the app will opened up when I pressed the box to tick what I've completed everytime,positive
15386,"I really like this app for the most part, but I really don't like how the month view in-app and on the widget don't actually list out what you have on that day, just colored dots. Would really like to be able to have this since I paid for the Pro version, please consider!",positive
15387,I think that feature of changing theme should be addef and apart from that there should also be a option for showing task on thr facr of calender itselg,positive
15388,I would like to be able to import my contacts to it. I would give 5 stars for that,positive
15389,Great user interface. Easy to use. Syncing with Google calendar is a huge advantage. From To-do lists to events you can schedule anything.,positive
15390,I love this app.  I have always been a Franklin Covey planner gal and this is similar to the paper planner.  Great search function.,positive
15391,The perfect planner..Only thing missing is that Remimder is not working..,positive
15392,Could you kindly add a weekly timetable-looking kind of view?,positive
15393,Add alarms to notification in events or tasks and allow to add ringtone on it. Love it,positive

15400,Almost all the functionality of the Franklin Planner. This is a great app!,positive
15401,"This is the app which I use for almost a year. There is one issue I have faced recently. Namely, some tasks and events do not synchronize on multiple devices where I installed the app. I'm using this app on my Android smartphone, as well as on iPad. I would be very pleased if you fix it.",positive
15402,Nice app. But can update a function such as we can add in an attachment(like photo) into the task or etc will be better,positive
15403,Works great most of the time however crashes when making my display size small. Google pixel. Recurring error.,positive
15404,"Would have given it 5 stars, but it doesn't seem to want to rotate when using my tablet.",positive
15405,"I like this app. It has a lot of the features I use all in one place. However, even though it lists all my Google calendars, I can't figure out how to do anything with them. I have projects spread over a dozen calendars but I can't seem to add anything to any of them.",positive
15406,Awesome app. Wish had auto sort feature of priority task like Franklin planner use to have.,positive
15407,"This is a simple app, that gives me the capability of creating a to-do list, set event on my calendar and take notes...",positive

15409,It's a really great app,positive
15410,Cool,positive
15411,"This is the best planning app I ever tried. However, I subscribed to the ads-free version but I'm still getting a message telling me to subscribe to unlock the extra features. I also get the same message whenever I rotate the phone to landscape mode. Actually, the button that advertises for the full version did not go away even after buying it.",positive
15412,"Very Helpful, The Best Yet !",positive
15413,"I like the app, very helpful for lots of things, however I've lost my account twice. I've had to uninstall it and recreate my account. Very good otherwise tho",positive
15414,I loved this app. Worked so great I purchased it. Now it has logged me out and says I don't exist.,positive
15415,Nicely presented app. Efficient. Colourful.,positive
15416,I don't know. It works good and I like that you can add notes to the task that is very helpful. I just kind of would like to have a better weekly view. But all in all it gets the job done.,positive
15417,"I love this app and has been using it for more than a year, but lately it has bugs which changes the days when i opened it per-days. Please fix it",positive
15418,Like it a little even bought the pro version. But when I went to the website trying to find out how do you back up your data in the event something happens to your phone.,positive
15419,"I just installed this gem of an app this morning, and love its ease of use. However, there is a minor problem...the date in big numbers on the left is one day behind the monthly calendar.",positive
15420,Great app and easy to use. Would be great if there was a no date option on notes for like shopping lists ect. That aren't just for the day.,positive
15421,"It's generally good, but screen rotation doesn't work. so, I can't use this app upside down in Galaxy Tab10. If this problem isn't solved, I won't pay for the next year. It would be great if this problem is solved!",positive
15422,Good for studying,positive
15423,it is helpful.,positive
15424,Haven't been using this app for long but it seems great so far. I LOVE that incompleted tasks roll over to the current day. I just wish you could attach attach photos or files to your notes. That would make this a 5-star review.,positive
15425,"A today button would be helpful in the week view widget, so that you don't have to scroll back. And also the possibility to add more accounts. Are these features available in the pro version? Maybe the possibility to try it  for a short period of time...",positive
15426,"I am the most unorganized person ever, and this app has helped me a lot. I constantly put down when my projects, tests, etc are due. I even include my days off on it. I also love that you can not down little notes with this app as well.",positive
15427,It was very useful for me to plan my days until the latest update which the widget shows the wrong day and I am unable switch the day..,positive
15428,Why on earth when I'm on one day and create a task it schedules it for the day before that by default? just why?,positive
15429,This is a great planner app. Only thing missing is the ability to rotate into portrait or even rotate 180 degrees.,positive
15430,Would love to be able to customize the app more.  Need to add a dark theme and also add an agenda view.,positive
15431,User friendly and plenty of bells and whistles. ; ),positive

15433,This is what I have been finding ...,positive
15434,I liked it but is there a widget for the app?,positive
15435,Gud for organised businessman,positive
15436,Can you add time in notes also like events,positive
15437,"Each of the features acts like it should. Only two things kept this from five stars: 1 - the reminder is set by default to 15 min and there is no easy way to turn that off or set it to another time. 2 - the events are colorless, making them less at-a-glance for looking up your plans for the day. Other than those two things, I've got no complaints.",positive
15438,I am very pleased with this planner.  It synchronizes easily with my Google calendars and allows me to stay on my phone and computer with only one entry.  The free version does not include search and I have not found to make use of the various to do tabs as well schedule recurring events so I am going to try the paid version and see it meets the rest of my scheduling needs.,positive
15439,This application is very useful in helping keep me organized and paced. The only suggestion I'd make is on the interface. When checking off my tasks for the day the add new task button is in the way of pressing the cross off button. It's a bit annoying but I love this app.,positive
15440,Of all the planner apps I've used this has been the best one. I really love the widget. A few extras I wish I had but for the free version not bad. The biggest thing that bugs me is the force use of military time in the widget,positive
15441,Only thing I don't like is that when creating a recurring event the date doesn't show on the monthly view until you scroll over to the actual week of the event it would be a lot better if I could see those dates on the monthly view without having to scroll fix please for 5 star rating,positive
15442,"I like this app and use it on my Android phone and iOS iPad. It's easy to use, don't need to buy anything, and is clear. I don't love how some tasks are harder to remember and the reminder isn't how I expected, but it's a good app.",positive
15443,"Love this app!!!  😄   Only thing that bothers me is that when I put repeat on events, it only works sometimes.  So just make sure it actually fills in the reoccurring days that you choose.",positive
15444,I haven't had any problems with it so far. Just wish it had a tutorial so I can get the most from it without buying it,positive
15445,If only the calender icons cld stop piling up on the phobe task bar everytime one is due. So if I created 5 events to go off in an hr I'll have 5 icons piled up on my fone. It's not needed. Or at least put an option so people cld disable it if they don't want it.,positive

Hope you guys can fix this thank you! Great app good job",positive
15468,"Cool app, seems to have all I need at this point. My only 2c would be that 
the widget weekly view should have the option to see the 7 days ahead 
rather than the current week; if it's a Friday, I don't really care what I 
did on Monday, I wanna know what's happening next Monday",positive
15469,"Just a couple of things .... I don't like the fact that the reminders show 
up multiple times and I wish it had a to do list but other than that ... 
But other than that so far so good",positive
15470,Great,positive
15471,Just installed and am liking it so far. I do wish there was a way to disable the quotes and better utilize that space to see more of my actual calendar. Also sub tasks would be very useful. With those changes I might actually be able to downsize the apps I use.,positive
15472,I just need notification  tone more than these and much more long,positive
15473,Seems like there is a bug when trying to sync my notes to my dropbox account. Would give you 5 stars if fixed.,positive
15474,Haven't found how to sync between two devices yet!,positive
15475,Good job,positive
15476,"Things were going great until I switched to a new phone .I can't find out how to sync my tasks and events to the new phone. I installed the app in my new phone and logged in, but the data is not there . I see that the events comes from the Google calendar, and I may be able to do something about that - but how do I sync the tasks ? Pls help.",positive
15477,Awesome,positive
15478,Great user interface. Easy to use. Syncing with Google calendar is a huge advantage. From To-do lists to events you can schedule anything.,positive
15479,I love this app.  I have always been a Franklin Covey planner gal and this is similar to the paper planner.  Great search function.,positive
15480,Great Tool,positive
15481,"I really like this app for the most part, but I really don't like how the month view in-app and on the widget don't actually list out what you have on that day, just colored dots. Would really like to be able to have this since I paid for the Pro version, please consider!",positive
15482,"I like this app. It has a lot of the features I use all in one place. However, even though it lists all my Google calendars, I can't figure out how to do anything with them. I have projects spread over a dozen calendars but I can't seem to add anything to any of them.",positive
15483,ItS pretty good.,positive
15484,Could you kindly add a weekly timetable-looking kind of view?,positive
15485,Nice apps. But need to re download the full version.,positive
15486,"Great App, but would be good if you could edit tasks after you've written them.  Also would be good if it could have, a daily 'things to do list'on.calendar ,which could be ticked off alongside projects /tasks.",positive
15487,Overall a good app but I would also like the option of switching from landscape view.,positive
15488,Add alarms to notification in events or tasks and allow to add ringtone on it. Love it,positive
15489,"Great Very usefull, please add fitur search to find an old note",positive
15490,A great app. I just downloaded it and I already love it. The only issue here is slight ui bugs. November 2017 gets covered up by the tabs at the top and on the day section the date runs into the calender layout. Again great app but those errors make the app look less professional. I would recommend rescaling the fragments so they fit better on the page as well as the toolbar. Definitely am recommending to friends though,positive
15491,Good enaught,positive
15492,Ok,positive
15493,The perfect planner..Only thing missing is that Remimder is not working..,positive
15494,This app is great but maybe let us tick task we completed from widget as it's annoying the app will opened up when I pressed the box to tick what I've completed everytime,positive
15495,I think that feature of changing theme should be addef and apart from that there should also be a option for showing task on thr facr of calender itselg,positive
15496,I would like to be able to import my contacts to it. I would give 5 stars for that,positive
15497,The essence and notion of this application is not just to define activities from day to day basis but to remind us that its really not about perfection... Its about progress... This application teaches us not just to address holistically in our commitment and time management but also push drastically at the same time our attitude towards commitments.. Senior Project Engineer here... It really helps alot... Thank you.,positive
15498,"I really like this app - its a lovely interface, simple to use and very useful to have both tasks and notes with the calendar. Is there any possibility of adding a folder/tag/category function to the notes?  It would be so helpful - I make notes on a varietu of things as I go along, and its really useful to be able to store them by day, but it would also be great to be able to sort them by tags or folders. Anyway - just a suggestion. Otherwise a lovely app. Thanks :-)",positive
15499,"Awesome app! It helps me a lot to organize my life, work and other stuffs. The features are really amazing! Would recommend this to my friends and colleagues.",positive
15500,"Almost perfect. The only changes that would be helpful is a quicker way to switch from the week view to the task list. And i would like to see my tasks as a list by default instead of clicking on the task categories. Also I wish that you had a rollover option for tasks, I have yet to find an app that had this: basically I wish when I create a task I could choose if the task carries forward to the next day if not completed or not.",positive
15501,I like it,positive
15502,"I went a got the full subscription and I really like it so far, but I wish you could download it for your PC as well.",positive
15503,It's cool,positive
15504,I just downloaded this.  The free version was definitely useful but I went ahead and got the paid version because I wanted to use the repetitive tasks and weekly planner as well.  I definitely think this will be worth the purchase.,positive
15505,I really like this app and ised to love it until there was an update that was stopping me from using it without upgrading. If i had to pay a one time purchase thats one thing but an annual fee?? Give me a break. $5 for a planner app is reasonable if you use it all of the time but not every year. Yall are greedy.,positive
15506,"This app is great! But i have some suggestions that would even better improve the quality of using the app. for example, something like being able to edit the tasks widgets to show 'due soon' instead of just tasks for that day for even better planning.",positive
15507,"Great app!    Help,  I unfortunately forgot my password (I was very sure it's correct but I'm not sure why it says it's wrong). Is there anything that can be done about it?",positive
15508,This is a great planner app. Only thing missing is the ability to rotate into portrait or even rotate 180 degrees.,positive
15509,The app was working fine until I removed Google Now. Now the widgets will not show on home page.,positive
15510,planned not bad,positive
15511,"This is the app which I use for almost a year. There is one issue I have faced recently. Namely, some tasks and events do not synchronize on multiple devices where I installed the app. I'm using this app on my Android smartphone, as well as on iPad. I would be very pleased if you fix it.",positive
15512,Greatly improved comment from me.  MUCH better than a year ago.  Most updated lead to improvement.  Wish the ' want an annual subscription.,positive
15513,It's 👍,positive
15514,Almost all the functionality of the Franklin Planner. This is a great app!,positive
15515,The calendar reminders can be very shotty but the overall app is very useful,positive
15516,"This is a simple app, that gives me the capability of creating a to-do list, set event on my calendar and take notes...",positive
15517,It's a really great app,positive
15518,If only the calender icons cld stop piling up on the phobe task bar everytime one is due. So if I created 5 events to go off in an hr I'll have 5 icons piled up on my fone. It's not needed. Or at least put an option so people cld disable it if they don't want it.,positive
15519,Cool,positive
15520,This planner pro is very nice and better for you time schedule,positive
15521,Awesome app. Wish had auto sort feature of priority task like Franklin planner use to have.,positive
15522,Works great most of the time however crashes when making my display size small. Google pixel. Recurring error.,positive
15523,Nice app. But can update a function such as we can add in an attachment(like photo) into the task or etc will be better,positive
15524,"Would have given it 5 stars, but it doesn't seem to want to rotate when using my tablet.",positive
15525,"This is the best planning app I ever tried. However, I subscribed to the ads-free version but I'm still getting a message telling me to subscribe to unlock the extra features. I also get the same message whenever I rotate the phone to landscape mode. Actually, the button that advertises for the full version did not go away even after buying it.",positive
15526,"Very Helpful, The Best Yet !",positive
15527,"I like the app, very helpful for lots of things, however I've lost my account twice. I've had to uninstall it and recreate my account. Very good otherwise tho",positive
15528,Nicely presented app. Efficient. Colourful.,positive
15529,I loved this app. Worked so great I purchased it. Now it has logged me out and says I don't exist.,positive
15530,I don't know. It works good and I like that you can add notes to the task that is very helpful. I just kind of would like to have a better weekly view. But all in all it gets the job done.,positive
15531,Like it a little even bought the pro version. But when I went to the website trying to find out how do you back up your data in the event something happens to your phone.,positive
15532,"I love this app and has been using it for more than a year, but lately it has bugs which changes the days when i opened it per-days. Please fix it",positive
15533,"It's a nice planner, I just prefer a different layout. I also don't care for the color.",positive
15534,"I just installed this gem of an app this morning, and love its ease of use. However, there is a minor problem...the date in big numbers on the left is one day behind the monthly calendar.",positive
15535,Great app and easy to use. Would be great if there was a no date option on notes for like shopping lists ect. That aren't just for the day.,positive
15536,"It's generally good, but screen rotation doesn't work. so, I can't use this app upside down in Galaxy Tab10. If this problem isn't solved, I won't pay for the next year. It would be great if this problem is solved!",positive
15537,it is helpful.,positive
15538,"Love the layout, and automatic carryover of tasks to next day.    One problem:  I have installed Planner Pro on my iPad and my Android phone.  The calendar events and tasks cannot be synced between my two devices.  Very frustrated.  Please add this sync feature soon.",positive
15539,However there are a few bugs. Every so often one of my recurring tasks will appear twice on one day and I have to delete it. The synchronization with drop box isn't good enough to use on two devices. I would be useful if you could choose 'third Sunday of every month' for recurring tasks,positive
15540,Good for studying,positive
15541,"I like this app and use it on my Android phone and iOS iPad. It's easy to use, don't need to buy anything, and is clear. I don't love how some tasks are harder to remember and the reminder isn't how I expected, but it's a good app.",positive
15542,Haven't been using this app for long but it seems great so far. I LOVE that incompleted tasks roll over to the current day. I just wish you could attach attach photos or files to your notes. That would make this a 5-star review.,positive
15543,Would love to be able to customize the app more.  Need to add a dark theme and also add an agenda view.,positive
15544,"A today button would be helpful in the week view widget, so that you don't have to scroll back. And also the possibility to add more accounts. Are these features available in the pro version? Maybe the possibility to try it  for a short period of time...",positive
15545,I liked it but is there a widget for the app?,positive
15546,It was the best Just one thing is not good😑 That is not hard I need to reorder by finger rapid and soft Like wunderlist and others... (I don't wanna to go in task and change priority 🤦‍♂️ It's so hard to imagine 🤔that work was what?.. ) You are great ! Thank you.,positive
15547,"You win, take my money. I have been using this app for many years and never bought the upgrade. I recently upgraded to the S10, and between Bixby, Google, and many planning apps, I just couldn't separate myself from this one. I simply have not found an app that's easier to add and complete tasks. Also the task widget is just hands down better than every other one out there. So fine, if you want to add fullscreen ads (and have the audacity to include sound) then take my money you can have it.",positive
15548,"I have never seen a more beautifully designed calendar+planner app. Easy on eyes, strikes a great balance between functionality and simplicity (Google and Microsoft calendar apps should take inspiration from this) and ... just great. When I start earning I'm definitely going to buy this app just to show gratitude :)",positive
15549,"This is the best planing app I could find on the play store. It syncs with my Google calendar enabling it to be an all inclusive planner, but also has lots of personal orginazational abilities. I am very impressed with this planner and would recommend it to anyone who likes to be very well planned.",positive
15550,"Amazing work done for this app. I have looked for a long time for an app which was fast, well developed and really easy to use. Keep this way always!",positive

15553,"Great support, ads were displayed, dev had it fixed in a day. Thank you, and great product. it's the closest thing to a Franklin Planner I have found.",positive
15554,This is by far the best overall organizer app I have found. My only complaint would be the lack of multi tiered tasks.,positive
15555,Helps me to organize my day when I don't have my physical planner at hand held me to remember important and vidal tasks that help sort out my family and daily routines while allowing to add onto my busy schedules throughout the week also able to sort out the important tasks by colour coordination . Thank you for the opportunity to have a great planner at my 👆 fingertips,positive
15556,"I really like the planner, it helps me achieve my tasks, goals & have an avenue to scribe my ideas down. Double thumbs up!",positive
15557,Would pay for this if there were even more additions and updates. Absolutely love it and wish they would develop it even further,positive
15558,"I Like the clear & unclutter look, everything is organized..wished i could export it without having to pay extra.",positive
15559,I've used planner pro for 5 years or more now. Couldn't do without it.,positive

15588,good,positive
15589,"I have long been an advocate of the Stephen Covey 7 Habits Weekly Planner 
approach. This is the first app I've found that gives me the capability I 
need to do that well. I use the ""projects"" section to set up my ""roles and 
goals,"" and then transfer them to my weekly calendar. My only wish is that 
the tablet and phone app worked with their desktop app; it does not, as far 
as I can tell.",positive
15590,"Hi, I love this app and have been using it for a while now (it is the only 
one that have calendar and to-do fit togheter), the only thing that I would 
add for my needs is the possibility to share with others our activities. 
Even in the paid version seems to not have this feature. Are you guys 
planning to add it on?",positive
15591,"I like using this app, helps me write when I most need it and has helped me 
use it whenever i can't explain or Express myself. So thank you 🌿❤",positive
15592,Needs A Recipe Section And Separate Lists For Different Members Of Family.,positive
15593,"It's very optimised for everyday notifications, notes, list making and planning in general. The widget is quite handy, offering a preview of all the day of the week and tasks and events you have written down! My recommendation.",positive
15594,"This calendar is lovely to use. Minimalist, asthetically pleasing and 
exactly the functions (and view options) I was looking for. Love it!",positive
15595,It is a great app and it helps me keep my schoolwork on time,positive
15596,"I love this app, it combined of my calendars and keeps me on task.",positive

15612,great to help organize,positive
15613,"I'm obsessed with this app. I LOVE that you can make separate checklists for different types of tasks. I love having the ability to categorize my tasks/chores so I don't end up getting overwhelmed by the long list. Not only that, but you can sort your lists by due date, priority, or in alphabetical order and set tasks to repeat on certain days of the week instead of every so many days. The widgets are gorgeous and it's so easy to use the checklists without opening the app. I've never been so on top of things.  Oh AND the calendar links to Google so I don't ever have to worry about losing or transferring events. This app is exactly what I've been looking for. I'm so glad I finally found it!!",positive
15614,"The planner pro is very helpful and works as it mentioned.  Addition of a black background will makes the app more attractive  Other issue i encountered is when ever  set a passcode the app log out automatically showing a dialouge box that your password has been changed , and when i try to log in using password on next screen  it prompt for passcode and the app don't open with Correct passcode.so now i set passcode and password same so now the app works fine.",positive
15615,Is there any way to link the planner with your laptop? If my phone breaks or is lost will I lose everything in the planner?,positive
15616,I really find this very useful and easy to use. Very user friendly. Only problem is there is no way to delete all completed tasks...it has to be done one by one. Any chance of fixing that?,positive
15617,"Best app to keep me up to date. Helps me remember all my tasks along with their due dates. I tried many apps to help me remember my tasks( as my memory is a bit weak),  but I must say that this app has best helped me. I just loved it.",positive
15618,"In love with this app! I use it everyday,  all the time. I have bad memory, so this app always helps me at keeping track of things!",positive
15619,Absolutely amazing. The only planner app I can actually successfully use. I'm really bad with these and my brain seems to like this one's straightforward interface.,positive
15620,Almost perfect.  Simple to use.  I like that you can add tasks for each day.  However you don't get the week view on the free version.  Annoying!,positive
15621,Really amazing and helped me sooo much just i hope that it can be sharable by more than one person for group planning one line and it will be world organizer or making groups ... thanx for developers,positive
15622,"This app is great! Love how it harnesses events,task, and notes all in one simple interface! I would love to see a Google chrome version! Wouldn't suggest changing much, it would just be more convenient to plan everything out using a desktop or laptop rather than using a phone or tablet. Also, the widget functions need some improvement. If possible it would be nice to see a daily widget with events tasks and notes for the day. Overall really like the app!",positive
15623,This app is great. It keeps me on track with things i need to do! Works great for me and i dont have any major problems at all.,positive

15627,"This is awesome, my life is easily organised with this app, and I could look at everything and visualize in a whole calendar. :D",positive
15628,It's an amazing app. Does what it promises. Easy to use and a cool feature is it pushes due tasks to the next day which helps a lot.,positive

approach. This is the first app I've found that gives me the capability I 
need to do that well. I use the ""projects"" section to set up my ""roles and 
goals,"" and then transfer them to my weekly calendar. My only wish is that 
the tablet and phone app worked with their desktop app; it does not, as far 
as I can tell.",positive
